          "title": "Why 2021 Is Probably Not a Good Year for Real Estate Investments in the U.S.",
          "text": "Let\u2019s start off with the good news: 2021 probably won\u2019t be as bad as 2020 was, for obvious reasons. However, economically speaking, it\u2019s definitely not going to be smooth sailing either. The world is still pulling itself together after a traumatic year (and that\u2019s an understatement), so recovery from is bound to take a while.\n\nNevertheless, some sectors of the economy are projected to bounce back on their feet much faster than others, naturally. Let\u2019s focus on one that analysts are not very optimistic about: the real estate market in the United States. When trying to understand why this sector has become unattractive for investors, three main reasons stand out and are important to be familiar with.\n\n1. The Biden administration (what awaits investors)\n\nJoe Biden, America\u2019s 46th president, has only been in office for a week so it\u2019s too soon to tell where his financial compass is going to lead the nation. One thing is for sure, though: His plans are generally to do the exact opposite of his predecessor. His promises during the campaign, along with what we already know about his financial plan for dealing with the pandemic, are just his first step in that direction.\n\n\n\nSource: https://pixabay.com/illustrations/joe-biden-president-american-flag-5837244/\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is adopting a socialist approach, which may be good news for the lower classes of America, but not for investors \u2013 especially not in real estate,\u201d told us told us Ofir Bar, a successful investor with over two and a half decades of experience with both real-estate ventures and technology start-up companies in the global and the American market. \u201cFor example, Biden plans on taxing long-term capital gains, which is something that definitely changes the whole cost-benefit equation of real estate property and makes you want to consider every future investment twice.\u201d\n\n2. COVID \u2013 19 recovery (better late than never)\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since the first recorded case of Coronavirus in the United States \u2013 and we all remember how quickly that had escalated into thousands passing away every day. Despite all of that, and while nations around the world are deep into their recovery plans by now, the U.S. seems to be waking up a bit late.\n\nThis probably has to do with the change of governments, and the fact that the Trump administration did not take significant steps to fight the spread of the virus. Be that as it may, the bottom line is that while the U.S. is still trying to figure out its path to wellness, it\u2019s going to be rough over there, financially speaking. With more questions than answers regarding when and how the American economy is set to get back on track, investing over there is not recommended \u2013 especially not large sums of money, as real estate investments normally require.\n\nSource: https://unsplash.com/photos/Sb5my2A8Mq8\n\n3. Take your business somewhere else\n\nHaving said that, a look at other places around the globe will probably yield more attractive possibilities for real estate investments. The main factor to look at today is where the financial situation is already stable enough to promise a clear future for your money on one hand, while governments and economic institutions are still putting in place policies encouraging investments on the other.\n\n\u201cTake a look at the European real estate market today,\u201d added Ofir Bar, \u201cand you\u2019ll understand why maybe you should give America the cold shoulder for now, if you\u2019re into real estate investments. Despite the pandemic hitting hard there, nations are in competition between themselves, with the goal of attracting foreign investments. This means less bureaucracy, comfortable taxation plans, financial aid given to construction companies, etc. While the U.S. is opting for a \u2018take from the rich and give to the poor\u2019 approach, Europe is trying to encourage its economy to pick up with investments, governmental and foreign.\u201d\n\nOh, and one more thing\u2026\n\nAll in all, one must remember that the time of writing is January 2021, and a whole lot can change in the next few months. This assessment is relevant considering the economic conditions existing today in the U.S. (and outside of it), which don\u2019t seem so favorable toward real estate investments. However, each case or offer should be examined specifically as well as with the background we\u2019ve given here."

          "title": "The Art of the Backup Plan: How to Protect Your Business in 2021",
          "text": "2020 was \u2013\u2013 to put it mildly \u2013\u2013 a difficult year for just about everyone. While a once-in-a-generation pandemic was impossible to predict, it is worth noting that many businesses were able to survive this unprecedented challenge because they had numerous contingency plans in place. If business leaders should take any lessons from 2020, it\u2019s that it\u2019s always important to be prepared to face big problems \u2013\u2013 even if you don\u2019t know what those problems will be! To that end, today we\u2019ll explain how the best businesses form backup plans for all types of issues, and what you can do to protect your organization for years to come.\n\nEmployee Retention\n\nOne of the best ways to insulate your business from potential turmoil is to assemble and retain a talented core of capable employees. Regardless of industry, all businesses benefit from the services of excellent professionals. What\u2019s more, having experienced team members on hand will often help you address issues when they arise. As such, it\u2019s important to keep your best employees happy by offering bonuses, performance-based incentives, and other perks. In addition, savvy business leaders also have plans for dealing with the unexpected loss of key employees. (You can contact a company like Helm Financial for more information on this subject.)\n\nSustainable Growth\n\nMany entrepreneurs are fascinated by the possibility of rapidly growing their business. Yet, more often than not, it\u2019s better to focus on sustainable growth practices than to spread your resources too thin. Expanding your operation too quickly could leave your organization strapped for cash. And should financial trouble hit at the wrong time, your once-promising business could suddenly begin to fall apart. Slow and steady definitely is the better option here.\n\nLong-Term Practices\n\nIt can be easy for business leaders to focus only on the here and now when they make key decisions for their company. The bad news that prioritizing short-term goals over long-term objectives can leave your business in a bad spot down the line. Given that fact, it\u2019s important to set aside some resources toward long-term endeavors like digital marketing, for example. Planting that seed now could lead to serious results in the future when you need them most.\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting a business is a difficult task. Keeping it going for years and years may be even more challenging. By keeping these tips in mind, though, ambitious entrepreneurs can ensure the long-term viability of their businesses. It\u2019s never too early \u2013\u2013 or too late \u2013\u2013 to start planning for the future!"

          "title": "7 Tips for Better Mental Health in 2021",
          "text": "Mental health has become a growing concern in the 21st century. Things like excessive screen time and financial stress have stoked anxiety in some and depressed millions of others.\n\nTo top it all off, in the summer of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic struck. In a poll released in the middle of last year, 53% of American adults reported that stress was on the rise. Specifically, they claimed that \u201ctheir mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus.\u201d\n\n2021 offers a fresh start. As is always the case, the turning of the annual clock has reset many hopes. However, if you\u2019re anticipating finding a greater sense of mental health this year, you have to look further than hope. Here are a few tips and suggestions for ways that you can act on that hope and cultivate a better mindset over the next year.\n\nUse Less Tech\n\nTechnology can be a major factor in poor health. Too much screen time can strain the eyes. Blue light before bed has a reputation for disrupting sleep. Computer games have led many to struggle with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nOne of the biggest mental health threats that tech has created comes via the smartphone. From social media apps to new notifications, phones have a bad habit of creating stress. Some of the best ways to care for your mental health, as far as your phone is concerned, are to:\n\nDelete unnecessary apps off of your phone.\n\nSet screen time limits for yourself.\n\nTurn your phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d whenever possible.\n\nIf you have children, get them a phone for kids that restricts internet access.\n\nEliminating notifications and withdrawing the 24-hour news cycle can do wonders in freeing up your mind.\n\nCultivate a Positive Attitude\n\nWhile you can do specific things such as reduce your screen time, you won\u2019t get far unless you also address your internal thought processes. Things like anxiety and depression thrive on pessimism. This is why positivity has such a good reputation as an antidote to mental health concerns.\n\nWith that in mind, one of the simplest ways you can boost your mental health is by embracing a positive mindset. This isn\u2019t referencing shallow activities like \u201cthinking happy thoughts.\u201d It involves conscientiously choosing to be thankful, grateful, and mindful. This trifecta of inner thoughts can be applied to your surroundings, your circumstances, and your life in general.\n\nGet Consistent Exercise\n\nExercise is another well-known mental health tool. Along with many obvious physical benefits, exercise also has the effect of releasing endorphins. This can combat stress in your mind and help you feel at peace.\n\nUnfortunately, the pandemic has thrown a wrench into many exercise activities and routines. However, there are still many ways to sneak in some exercise. For instance, you can:\n\nGet a bicycle or an electric bike.\n\nFind a good hiking trail.\n\nSign up for a live stream workout session.\n\nOutside activity is always the best way to go, as it also exposes you to sunlight and fresh air. Even so, if exercising inside is your only option, it\u2019s still a good one to consider.\n\nJournal Your Experiences\n\nJournaling is another excellent way to calm a frazzled mind. Consider committing to writing down your experiences and feelings on a regular basis.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to share this information with anyone. However, many people find that putting their thoughts and feelings into written words can make a huge difference in how their mind operates. The activity allows you to process what you\u2019re going through. It also helps you express your feelings without significant consequences.\n\nDeclutter Your Living Spaces\n\nA disorganized and messy space can have a surprisingly nefarious effect on your mental health. Clutter is known to cause stress in a variety of different ways. Each messy room reminds you of the work that you have to do. Calming activities that require space, such as a home workout, can be difficult. Even a messy computer desktop can drain your energy and make you feel stressed out.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your mental health, take some time to declutter your home. Don\u2019t just do this once, either. Schedule in consistent times to keep your spaces neat, orderly, and organized. Your mind will thank you in the long run.\n\nFind Creative Outlets\n\nCreativity isn\u2019t just fun. It\u2019s also very good for your mental state. Look for ways to exercise your creativity, such as:\n\nExperimenting with new recipes.\n\nLearning how to paint.\n\nBrushing up on your creative writing.\n\nEngaging in a creative activity is a good way to reign in untethered thoughts. It helps you relax and focus on the present.\n\nUnplug on Purpose\n\nUnplugging is a powerful mental health activity. It consists of detaching from responsibilities, commitments, technology, and any other draining factors in your life. This is done for a set period of time, whether that is an hour, a day, or a month. Often successfully unplugging consists of doing little to nothing in an attempt to enjoy some stress-free time.\n\nUnplugging enables you to slow down. It provides time to gather your thoughts. You can exist in the present rather than fretting about the past or worrying about the future. It also gives you a chance to do other activities, such as journaling, exercising, or flexing your creativity.\n\nWhen used together, all of these tips can create synergistic results. However, none of them will be effective unless you choose to genuinely embrace them. In other words, the process starts with you. If you can commit to fighting for your mental health, you\u2019ll find a way to conquer the stress, anxiety, and depression sooner or later.\n\nSo, take a hard look at the above suggestions. Find one that stands out and implement it as soon as possible. Then add another one from there. The sooner you start battling for your mental health, the better off you\u2019ll be as you navigate a year that is filled with uncertainty."

          "title": "How Ryan Kavanaugh Got Mike Tyson Back In The Ring",
          "text": "Ryan Kavanaugh, the billionaire film producer, has made a name for himself as a visionary across multiple entertainment industries, including film, television, and sports, and his latest foray into social media is no different. Since his company Proxima Media acquired the AI-powered social media music video platform Triller in 2015, Kavanaugh has been working tirelessly to not only expand its reach and usability, but break new ground.\n\nTriller, which has had over 250 million downloads to date, has exploded in usership since Kavanaugh came on board. Triller has gained attention for both its introduction of Crosshype and the app\u2019s refusal to embrace censorship in a time where most social media platforms are doing exactly the opposite. Crosshype is Kavanaugh\u2019s innovative brand growth program that helps determine a Triller campaign\u2019s value in cost per thousand views with a calculabe cost per impression. However, even more impressive than innovations like Crosshype, Kavanaugh has leveraged his entertainment connections to pull off an incredible event.\n\nOn November 28, Triller hosted Tyson on Triller, an epic pay-per-view, live-streamed event featuring an 8-round match between boxing icons Mike Tyson and Roy Jones, Jr. For just $49.99 (about half the price of an in-person UFC event), viewers had access to the Tyson vs. Jones main event, musical performances by Lil Wayne, French Montana, Wiz Khalifa and YG, and Ne-Yo, and six other undercard matches, including Jake Paul vs. Nate Robinson and Badou Jack vs. Blake McKernan. The event provided commentary by boxing icon Sugar Ray Leonard, as well as current UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya.\n\nBack in May of 2020, Kavanaugh saw a video Mike Tyson had posted to his Instagram of himself training in the boxing ring, and the idea was born. After getting in touch with media mogul Sophie Watts, who was working with Tyson at the time, Kavanaugh began laying plans for what would become the launch of live events on Triller.\n\nKavanaugh, well-connected to all branches of the entertainment industry from his past business endeavors, cashed in on his celebrity contacts to create a multi-faceted event with broad appeal to many different generations and interests.\n\nThe event took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and although they could not sell physical tickets due to current Covid-19 restrictions, the event brought in 300,000 ticket purchases, and streamed on TysonOnTriller.com and Fite.TV. Although the Triller app itself did not host the event, it generated income through sponsorships, advertising and selling merchandise, and the Triller logo was smartly displayed prominently throughout the event. Triller users also had access to exclusive content, such as a docu-series showing Tyson and Jones preparing for the fight, that was posted by the headliners as well as the other fighters.\n\nAccording to Kavanaugh, this event is just the start of a new form of entertainment users can expect from Triller, with plans for many live, virtual concerts from top musical acts in the works that would sell viewership for a few dollars each. This innovative way for consumers to experience live events comes at a time when the public needs it most, as no one is sure when large-scale events will once again be able to safely accommodate live audiences.\n\nOn the event, Kavanaugh stated, \u201cWe want this to go down as one of the most epic events in history. We want this to go down, where people are remembering how we brought together the culmination of boxing, live music concerts, celebrities, influencers, social media and content all into one event, where the first time in a very long time, a son and a daughter, a mother and a father, a grandmother and a grandfather can all be watching the same thing and say I love this. There\u2019s something for all of them, like a generational bridge so to speak. Those don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nOnce again, the challenges caused by the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 have sparked innovation that will undoubtedly make lasting changes to how we consume live entertainment now and in the future, and Ryan Kavanaugh is at the forefront."

          "text": "My friends at Feral House shared an exclusive excerpt from Steven Blush's book, Bustin' Balls: World Team Tennis 1974-1978, Pro Sports, Pop Culture, and Progressive Politics.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nBustin' Balls tells the strange but true story of World Team Tennis (1974-1978) that attempted to transform the prim and proper individual sport of tennis into a rowdy blue-collar league. Billie Jean King and her partners merged feminism and civil rights with queer lifestyle, pop culture and a progressive political agenda to create a dazzling platform for the finest tennis players of the day to become overnight stars.\n\nIconic trailblazer King infamously played a hyped 1973 Battle of the Sexes against Bobby Riggs proving definitively that women athletes were competitive equals and changed the sports landscape forever. The vision of the World Tennis League with its mixed-sex teams and looser rules that encouraged fast and aggressive play, propelled tennis into a television fixture and the players into household names.\n\nEvonne Goolagong who fought racism throughout her life was the first indigenous woman to win at Wimbledon and a member of the Pittsburgh Triangles was America's introduction to a person of Aboriginal heritage. Chris Evert of the Los Angeles Strings became America's sweetheart. Billie Jean King played for the Philadelphia Freedoms at the height of Bicentennial fervor and was feted by Elton John in the song, \"Philadelphia Freedom\". And there's no forgetting the bad boys of the court! Tabloids followed the nightlife exploits and made pin-ups of Ilie Nastase, Jimmy Connors, and Vitas Gerulitis.\n\nRelive the most fun tennis ever had in the photo-filled history, Bustin' Balls",

          "text": "By Entertainment, Featured\n\nEXT. STREET \u2014 NIGHT\n\nA WOMAN walks alone on a rainy night. A masked MAN crouches in the field beside her. He holds a gun.\n\nThis opening could describe almost any procedural drama, a genre inhabited by old masters such as Fritz Lang and modern day titans like Denis Villeneuve. While it contains some of the greatest films ever made, in recent years it has been mostly associated with the type of show you\u2019d catch on TV at 4:30 on a Wednesday, like \u201cBones\u201d or \u201cNCIS.\u201d In a genre that is so saturated, it can become difficult to find content that breaks the mold and propels the format forward.\n\nBong Joon-Ho\u2019s \u201cMemories of Murder\u201d (2003) not only brought the procedural to a new place but set the bar as the finest one of them all.\n\nThe classic procedural usually revolves around the solving of a crime by the police. This presents a few issues. Namely, it has often led to the glorification of the police to an almost absurd degree. For example, in \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d the police are presented as an entirely good presence, with no \u201cbad cops.\u201d Even when the police are presented in a more complex manner, such as in \u201cLaw and Order,\u201d the corrupt actions of the police are always outweighed by the solving of the crime.\n\nThis leads to another issue: The predictability of most procedurals. You are almost always left with some sort of conclusion, that the criminal was caught. Even in a film like \u201cZodiac,\u201d they give you the criminal, even though, in reality, the Zodiac Killer was never caught. When the audience sees everything as predictable, what is the point of making a mystery? It takes real effort on the part of the filmmaker to push things in a new direction. Bong Joon-Ho brought the procedural to a place it had never been before.\n\n\u201cMemories of Murder\u201d is based on the real-life serial killings that took place in Hwaesong, South Korea between 1986 and 1991, the first of its kind in South Korea. When asked why he was doing the film, Bong said \u201cThere\u2019s an old tradition of crime movies in Korean cinema which are rather different from plot-oriented Hollywood thrillers, and I wanted to make something of that sort. The old-style Korean movies are essentially humane and emotional \u2014 that\u2019s what I like about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMemories of Murder\u201d does not start out gritty and dark \u2014 the first shot of the film is of a field on a sunny day, bathed in orange light. Bong uses long takes to emphasize the setting, allowing the viewer to sink into the film. When we see the first victim lying in a gutter, Bong makes sure we can see ants crawling off her corpse. The viewer understands that there is a depth to this case that is not seen in other films. Showing this image informs the audience that investigating murder is not as glamorous as we\u2019ve been led to believe.\n\nUsually in this genre, our \u201cleading man\u201d is a strong, brave, dominant figure, who is devoted to their work. In one scene, we see how Park Doo-Man is the exact opposite. He interviews potential suspects, and we see them almost disregard him entirely, not taking his questions seriously. We also see Park struggle through the interrogation, barely progressing at all in his line of questioning. This subverts one of the key themes in the procedural genre \u2014 that the police are both competent, and respected, if not feared.\n\nIn this film, rather than \u201cgood cops,\u201d the police are shown to be constantly arguing, forging evidence, beating and humiliating their suspects, and constantly failing at protecting the public. During a key scene in which police are needed to comb the area for the killer, they are shorthanded due to many officers suppressing a democratic uprising in a nearby city. This film portrays the police as an arm of the state, outwardly oppressing the people, a clear contrast to the portrayal seen in regular, often American procedurals.\n\nThough Bong subverts the expected tropes, \u201cMemories of Murder\u201d is still a procedural, and there is still a crime to solve. But while the audience would expect a straightforward approach \u2014 find the bodies, find suspects, find the killer \u2014 Bong chooses a different route.\n\nOur first suspect, Baek, is an intellectually disabled young man, who Park tries to frame for the murders after learning Baek had a crush on one of the victims. This culminates in a harrowing scene where Park and Cho force Baek to dig his own grave, while Seo, another detective, watches from behind. Seo finds Park\u2019s methods to be wrong and barbaric, but doesn\u2019t care enough to put a stop to all of this, only stepping in at the last second.\n\nOur second suspect is caught masturbating at the scene of one of the murders, but was found to be engaging in a sexual fantasy, not murder. While the methods used by the detectives here are essentially the same, a fight breaks out between Park and Seo after missing on another suspect, and they fail to stop another murder because of it.\n\nWe finally see the detectives working as a unit, and they find their final suspect, a factory worker named Park Hyeon-Gyu. They manage to get a DNA sample and send it to America to be tested, alongside DNA at the scene. This leads to the climax of the film. After a brutal murder of a young girl whom Seo had befriended, he goes to the suspect\u2019s house and starts beating him, throwing him onto the train tracks outside. As he is about to shoot him, Park runs in with the documents from America. As Seo opens the letter, he thinks he finally has his man, and just as his mantra, \u201cDocuments never lie,\u201d is about to come true\u2026 the test result is inconclusive.\n\nA crestfallen Seo betrays the ideology that has guided him and attempts to kill Hyeon-Gyu, but Park stops him. We see a reversal of ideologies, with the intellectual Seo being overtaken by his emotions, and Park not wanting to kill a potentially innocent man. After looking deep in Hyeon-Gyu\u2019s eyes, the only words Park can muster is, \u201cFuck I don\u2019t know. Do you wake up each morning too?\u201d The police have failed.\n\n\u201cMemories of Murder\u201d is the rare procedural that does not glorify its detectives. Everything that goes wrong in this film is their fault. They could have caught the killer if they weren\u2019t too busy arguing about who was a better detective. They could have secured the area if they weren\u2019t suppressing protests.\n\nThis leads us to the question: What is the point of all of this?\n\nWhen asked about his process in gathering information for the film, Bong said, \u201cThe person who had the strongest influence on me was an ex-cop who\u2019d worked on the case. He broke down in tears several times as we talked. This put me in a quandary \u2014 I\u2019ve never liked cops, maybe because of my student experiences fighting them, but talking to this man made me rethink. What struck me most was the purity of his desire to catch the criminal.\u201d\n\nA procedural appeals to something universal, the idea of justice, that the people who have done wrong will be caught. It functions as an escape from the harsh reality of the truth, that justice is a murky concept, and that most criminals get away with their crimes. When the genre becomes as saturated as it is, you begin to lose that escape, and the difference between the film and real life blurs. The cultural power of the genre extends far beyond the reality of its subjects. \u201cMemories of Murder\u201d shatters these ideas. It depicts the crushing fact that the people holding the power often wield it in a way that hurts everyone involved, that arrogant individualism guides us rather than a collective spirit."

          "title": "In Translation: On Kaal",
          "text": "By Literature\n\nAs I end one of my last semesters of graduate school, contend with the impact of COVID-19, and age deeper into my twenties, I\u2019ve been asking myself consistently: Who am I? Who will I be? Who was I? While these questions may seem generic, they are fundamental. Every time I ask them, the answers are different. Indian or American? Heterosexual or bisexual? Poet or essayist? I hold a lot of liminal identities, ones that are in flux and will always be in flux. In \u201cNacerima culture,\u201d Horace Miner writes, we ritually strive to create stagnant identities. Identities fixed in time, labeled, clear with the hope that they will be everlasting. But, must I choose only one? Coming from a household that speaks multiple languages, I have come to realize that English demands labelization in a way that other languages don\u2019t.\n\nFor example, in Hindi, my mother tongue, the word for yesterday and tomorrow is the same: kaal. One can only understand which one the speaker is referring to within the context of the conversation. It is merely, \u201cone day away from today\u201d without stating exactly in which direction. In Hindi, time is cyclical. The use of the same word for tomorrow and yesterday makes it unclear which comes first, showing that there is no first or last. While your past is affecting your present and future, your future is also affecting your perception of the present and past.\n\nThe origin of kaal stems from the last story at the end of the Ramayana, a Hindu epic. The Ramayana follows the journey of Lord Ram, an incarnation of God, and his wife Sita.\n\nAt the very end of Ramayana, after Sita descended and returned to her mother Earth, Lord Ram was disheartened.\n\nThe people of Ayodhya watched their Lord Ram caress the grass for a long time, stoic, serene as ever, not a tear in his eyes. His people wanted to fall at his feet, hug and comfort him. Those who have chosen to be born must also die, and Lord Ram was fully aware of that.\n\nOne day, while walking through the forest back to the Kingdom of Ayodhya, Hanuman (the monkey god) spots Yama (god of death) lurking near the gates of the kingdom. Hanuman, a true friend and a self claimed servant to Lord Ram, wanted to protect Lord Ram from any harm so he gave Yama a warning to never come close to the king and his kingdom.\n\nThe next day, Lord Ram lost his ring. It slipped from his finger and fell into a crack in the palace floor.\n\n\u201cWill you fetch it for me, Hanuman?\u201d requested Lord Ram.\n\nEver willing to please his Lord, Hanuman reduced himself to the size of a bee and slipped into the crack in the floor.\n\nTo his surprise it was a tunnel that led him to Naga Lok, the kingdom of snakes. There, he met the king of Naga Lok, Vasuki.\n\n\u201cI am seeking Lord Ram\u2019s ring, have you seen it?\u201d questioned Hanuman.\n\n\u201cOh that! You will find it there!\u201d said Vasuki, pointing to a vast mountain in the centre of Naga Lok.\n\nHanuman rushed to the mountain and found to his surprise that it was no mountain, but a gigantic pile of rings. Each ring an exact copy of his Lord Ram\u2019s ring.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked Vasuki, baffled by what he was looking at.\n\n\u201cDid you think there was only one ring?\u201d questioned Vasuki. \u201cI thought as the monkey god you knew. Every time a ring falls into Naga Lok, a monkey follows it and Lord Ram up above dies. This is not the first time it has happened. This is not the last time it will happen. So it has happened before. So it will happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does the story repeat itself again and again?\u201d Hanuman pondered.\n\n\u201cSo that every generation realizes the point of human existence.\u201d Vasuki replied.\n\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d Hanuman asked, curious as ever.\n\n\u201cFear is a constant and faith is a choice. Fear comes from karma and from faith arises dharma. Fear creates Ravanas (demons) who will always be in society and faith creates Lord Ram and his wife Sita. They come into being only if we have faith in the world even when it seems as if the world abandons us.\u201d\n\nAfter listening, Hanuman bows to the king, leaves Lord Ram\u2019s ring behind and without a word exits the tunnel to find the land of Ayodhya desolate without its lord, again (which is how the Ramayana starts).\n\nAnd so we return to the end\u2026 of this Ramayana.\n\nThere are many Lord Rams and many Ramayanas indicating that life is not linear. Life is cyclical: For what is the past is also the future.\n\nIn the same nas, or vein, who I am tomorrow or who I was yesterday, may be the same, but we will never know today. But the me I am today, is one that is always questioning, always growing towards, working towards. Today I have this time in my hands, and I can use it to build a world for both the future and past, because one day, the future will also be the past.\n\nLet\u2019s envision a kaal by examining kaal. Thus a world that centers justice and joy is a world that centers the importance of language. The language that surrounds our everyday lives. The language that celebrates our liminal identities and refuses to abide by the western construction of linear time. Language is power, but the power is in the non-labeling of ourselves and the world we see around us. The non-labeling of time.\n\nI\u2019m questioning. Always questioning. Just like kaal is. Just like Hanuman is. Just like the Ramayana is. Yesterday is always questioning. Tomorrow is always questioning.\n\nSo now what? I\u2019m questioning my sexuality, the next time I get to see my friends in person and hug them, how I\u2019m going to take care of my parents, my past actions, what my future will hold\u2026 We can only build a world by questioning ourselves and the systems that we have made to make sense of it all. Our words have a body and the body is us, moving through the time and space we carve out for ourselves."

          "text": "Thursday, February 4, 2021\n\nThe East Gippsland Shire Council, a local government body in Australia which governs towns such as Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance and Mallacoota, on Tuesday passed a motion supporting the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The motion originated from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a global campaign supporting implementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The motion called upon the council to write to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in indication of their support for the treaty.\n\n\n\nA global appeal for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty; 2016.\n\nThe motion was moved at Tuesday's council meeting by Councillor Tony Crook, and seconded by Councillor Jane Greacen. While Crook acknowledged \"clearly this forum has very little influence over the use or production of nuclear weapons\", he acknowledged Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle, stating nuclear weapons \"have bought untold misery to communities around the world\". Councillor Arthur Allan opposed the motion, saying while he agreed with what Crook and Greacen had stated, the issue of nuclear weapons was a \"federal issue\" and the motion amounted to \"virtue signalling\".\n\nDeputy Mayor Mark Reeves supported the motion, contending it was an issue of \"moral standing\" and representing the views of the community, quipping \"nobody's said to me \u2014 'You know what we need? A really good intercontinental ballistic missile in the shire.'\" Councillor Trevor Stowe called the motion \"feel-good stuff\" and \"an absolute waste of time\".\n\nThe vote ultimately resulted in a tie, with Crook, Greacen, Reeves, and Mayor Mendy Urie voting in support, and Councillors John White and Kirsten Van Diggele, as well as Allen and Stowe, voting against. Councillor Sonia Buckley abstained. Mayor Urie broke the tie in favour of the motion.\n\nThe Australian government has previously boycotted prohibition treaty talks, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stating \"a ban treaty risks undermining the [non-proliferation treaty] which Australia rightly regards as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation and disarmament architecture\". The opposition Labor Party has pledged to sign and ratify the treaty if elected to government.\n\n\n\n"

          "title": "LGBT+ history month: remembering the \u2018Glamour Boys\u2019 \u2013 the gay MPs who warned 1930s Britain about Nazism",
          "text": "In the 1920s and 1930s of buttoned-up Britain, homosexuality was an illicit act, and would remain that way until 1967 when the law changed in England and Wales. Even though gay culture was vibrant, it existed mostly underground, its community forced to socialise with a certain degree of covertness in order to avoid exposure and the risk of prison.\n\nBerlin, meanwhile, had emerged from the dark years following the first world war as a cultural hub of creativity and intellectualism, attracting pioneers in the fields of science, psychology, art and literature. The German capital was also a hotbed of hedonism where sexual freedoms and gay culture flourished, and where exciting new forms of music and dance contributed to the febrile atmosphere.\n\nOn visits to this liberal metropolis during that period, a small group of young British Conservative Party MPs \u2013 which included figures such as Ronald Cartland, Anthony Muirhead and Robert Bernays \u2013 began to witness the growing persecution of certain groups in Germany, including homosexuals and Jews.\n\nThis group of Conservative MPs was scathingly dubbed the \u201cGlamour Boys\u201d in 1938 by their own leader Neville Chamberlain, the then prime minister. Chamberlain, who would become the eventual architect of appeasement in the autumn of 1938, even threatened the group with deselection. The story of the Glamour Boys provides a striking example of how the political establishment was prepared to publicly disparage members of their own party.\n\nYet, despite the risk of exposing their own homosexuality at a time when it was illegal, the Glamour Boys brought their concerns to parliament throughout the 1930s. The rise of the Nazi party to power in 1933 marked the end of the Weimar Republic that had witnessed the cultural explosion of Berlin. A crackdown on gay culture in Germany saw the detainment of homosexuals, alongside police raids on popular bars and nightclubs.\n\nBut opposition to the rise of Hitler was certainly not the prevailing attitude in Britain at the time, either at Westminster or in public. There was plenty of enthusiasm for the F\u00fchrer among certain sections of British society including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor who met Hitler in Germany in 1937. Yet, even though the concerns of the Glamour Boys were vindicated as the 1930s and 1940s progressed, British history has failed to appreciate their prescience in the same manner as it has figures such as Winston Churchill.\n\nA forgotten contribution\n\nThe activity of the Glamour Boys peaked between 1938 and 1940, as Europe accelerated towards war. The Whitehall Newsletter provided a mouthpiece through which the group voiced their concerns at the growing threat of Nazism. The group was also prominent in parliamentary debates during the period, including those in 1938 surrounding the Munich Agreement which allowed German annexation of the Sudetenland, in western Czechoslovakia.\n\nThis group of young MPs provided essential critical mass to the dissenting anti-appeasement movements within the House of Commons, which came to be spearheaded by the likes of Anthony Eden and Winston Churchill. Without such backing, the two would have remained voices in the wind until the outbreak of war in 1939 became imminent.\n\nThe opposition to the rise of Nazism offered by Winston Churchill throughout his wilderness years of the 1930s has been well-documented. In a famous speech of November 1934, he expressed concern at rapid German rearmament. In British historical memory, Churchill has come to be viewed as a prophet of the horrors that were yet to unravel.\n\nBut the foresight and instincts of the Glamour Boys have faded from public memory. The story has only recently garnered attention, in large part thanks to the research of current Labour MP Chris Bryant whose book, The Glamour Boys: The Secret Story of the Rebels Who Fought for Britain to Defeat Hitler, sheds light on the story.\n\nWe should question why the Glamour Boys have not occupied a more prominent position in narratives of the second world war era. Churchill\u2019s political renaissance and redemptive rise to prime minister naturally magnified his own actions in the 1930s. This has likely come at the historical expense of other groups such as the Glamour Boys, who had also been vocal in their opposition to Nazism at the time.\n\nIt seems plausible that the sexuality of the Glamour Boys has prevented them from receiving their historical place. LGBT+ histories have not been well-accommodated in British narratives of the past. Only legalised in England and Wales in 1967, homosexuality remained taboo in the decades that followed. The fact that that the contemptuous moniker \u201cGlamour Boys\u201d endures perhaps speaks for itself.\n\nSimilarly, gay wartime codebreaker Alan Turing was only granted a posthumous royal pardon in 2013 for his conviction for gross indecency in 1952, which resulted in his brutal chemical castration.\n\nAn opportunity to reflect\n\nEvery February, LGBT+ History Month offers a chance to reflect on society past and present, and consider how certain stories have been airbrushed from national history. The political views and sexual orientation of the Glamour Boys have been marginalised, both at the time and retrospectively, despite their important contribution to British society. We need to reflect on how enduring social prejudices have shaped the way in which the nation remembers its past.\n\nThe Glamour Boys offer just one opportunity \u2013 among many \u2013 to diversify entrenched national narratives. There is danger in ignoring the voices of marginalised groups, and continual effort is required to eradicate unconscious bias in whichever context it might appear. It also provides a reminder of why history must feature narratives that contain multiple voices and perspectives, besides those of the status quo.\n\nAbove all, the story of the Glamour Boys is one of bravery. The courage displayed by this group of MPs extended well into the second world war, when several were killed in military action. In a time when homosexuality was prohibited, this group of young gay MPs risked their liberty \u2013 and later their lives \u2013 in the pursuit of social and political justice."

          "text": "She was declared Time magazine\u2019s person of the year in the same month that Donald Trump told her to \u201cwork on her anger management issues\u201d. Greta Thunberg has attracted international attention since her lone demonstration outside the Swedish Parliament in August 2018. Her \u201cschool strike for the climate\u201d has now grown into a global movement that has brought more than 10 million people onto streets worldwide to demand action on climate change.\n\nIn the same time that Greta Thunberg has become a household name, public concern about climate change has reached record highs in the US. But what role has Thunberg\u2019s personal influence played in this? Do her speeches appeal to diverse audiences or is she simply preaching to the choir?\n\nBased on a nationally representative survey of over 1,300 US adults, our study found that Americans who report being more familiar with Greta Thunberg also feel more confident that they can help mitigate climate change as part of a collective effort. They are also more willing to take action themselves, by contacting elected officials or giving time and money to campaigns. We call this the Greta Thunberg effect.\n\nFamiliarity breeds empowerment\n\nSeeing or hearing Greta Thunberg once doesn\u2019t instantly turn someone into a climate activist. Nonetheless, we discovered a potentially important pattern of associations. Those more familiar with Thunberg were more likely to think their actions were effective and meaningful and were more intent on doing something about climate change. Our model seemed to show this might be the case because people who knew Thunberg\u2019s story \u2013 how her lonely stand inspired millions around the world to join her \u2013 were more likely to recognise the potential for ordinary people to make a difference.\n\nWe wanted to know how widespread this effect might be, so we tried to find out which audiences Thunberg most appealed to. In her public appearances, she\u2019s often surrounded by young people and her demands for climate action align most strongly with liberal policy preferences. Since people tend to listen more to those they identify with, we thought that young and left-leaning people would be more strongly influenced by her.\n\nSurprisingly, the Greta Thunberg effect seems to be similar across age groups and the political spectrum for US adults, though it was stronger among liberals than conservatives. We didn\u2019t survey children and teenagers, but we expect them to be most strongly influenced by Thunberg\u2019s school strikes.\n\n\u2018No one is too small to make a difference\u2019\n\nPope Francis, James Hansen and Jeff Bezos have all tried to spur momentum on climate action using their religious, academic and financial authority. Greta Thunberg lacks any such elite status, so how has she been able to succeed?\n\nGiven the prevailing sense of doom about climate change, empowering people to take action requires an ability to convey that change is possible. In her speeches, Thunberg proclaims that \u201cthere is still time to change everything around\u201d. Her Fridays for Future campaign is also founded on the empowering message that anyone \u2013 even school students \u2013 can make a difference.\n\nMost importantly, Thunberg\u2019s actions are consistent with her words. Her fiery demands to world leaders, whether at the United Nations or the US Congress demonstrate that anyone can \u2013 and should \u2013 challenge powerful institutions and people.\n\nWhat does this mean for climate action?\n\nHow can we be sure that our findings reflect Greta Thunberg\u2019s own effect and not the influence of climate activism more generally? The short answer is that we can\u2019t. But to help isolate Thunberg\u2019s influence, we asked our study participants to rate their support for climate activism and found that familiarity with Thunberg remained relevant even when controlling for this.\n\nOf course, there are other things that could explain why people may want to take action on climate change, such as their prior support for environmental reform or their having heard about climate change in the news. But much of this is already captured indirectly by political ideology in our model, which is one of the most important predictors of what a person reads and how much they support climate action. So, while there are many reasons people might want to tackle climate change, being familiar with Greta Thunberg appears to have a unique influence on the extent to which they feel empowered to make a difference.\n\nBut what if the Greta Thunberg effect is actually operating the other way? Did we instead find that people who are already more likely to act on climate change are just more familiar with Greta Thunberg? We can\u2019t be certain because this type of study can\u2019t prove cause and effect, it can only show associations. But statistical tests showed that this reverse explanation did not explain the data as well as our original one. Of course, reality may be more complex than what our models can capture. A positive feedback loop \u2013 where both explanations operate in tandem to inspire climate action \u2013 is also possible.\n\nFuture research can build on our findings using controlled experiments, but the patterns in our data at least suggest that Greta Thunberg is a particularly inspirational leader in part because she\u2019s a convincing example that sudden, big change is possible. Now, how can activists amplify their own impact? Considering how politicised climate change is, one answer might be appealing to people across the political spectrum by highlighting aspects of their identity that they tend to share with the wider public. The Greta Thunberg effect suggests that calls to action may be able to mobilise broad segments of society, regardless of age or politics."

          "title": "Coronavirus school closures: what\u2019s the evidence?",
          "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been disastrous for many children, whose education and development have been badly affected by repeated school closures.\n\nSchools in the UK were first closed to most pupils as a pandemic control measure in March 2020 and again in January 2021 in response to the spread of the new variant of coronavirus.\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said that students in England will not return to school before March 8. Northern Ireland has selected the same date for the earliest possible return. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has announced that students will return in phases from February 22, while Wales is still considering when its school will reopen.\n\nThe closure of schools has been widely accepted, although it was recognised that the measures would hit children hard, especially those from deprived backgrounds, and those most vulnerable for medical or social reasons.\n\nThe effect of closing schools\n\nSchool closures reduce educational opportunities for children, with experts pointing to months of \u201clearning loss\u201d. It is not easy to deliver remote learning to all children, especially 1.8 million children in the UK do not have access to an internet-enabled device.\n\nSchool closures are also associated with increasing social isolation, poor wellbeing, domestic abuse and neglect. Children with disabilities are especially affected. They are generally more isolated than others and the support services they need may also be closed.\n\nThere are also consequences for parents and carers who may experience greater stress and mental health problems, as well as affecting their job security due to the pressure of home schooling.\n\nCan children catch COVID-19 easily?\n\nSome people argue that reopening schools is too risky. But it is a false dichotomy to judge schools as either \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cunsafe\u201d. The reality is more complicated. So what do we know so far about the actual risk of infection posed by children?\n\nNumerous bodies including the World Health Organization, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention have conducted expert reviews of the international evidence on this topic. From these, we understand that children can get infected with COVID-19, but the resulting illness is usually milder. Children shed less of the virus for less time and the duration of child illness is also shorter than in adults.\n\nChildren are therefore less likely to pass on the disease than adults and less susceptible to infection themselves. They are also less likely to be superspreaders. There is, however, a gradient of risk, with younger children being far less infectious than older teenagers. This continues to be the case with the new variant.\n\nInfections in schools\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to work out the actual contribution children make to infections in schools. One issue is that outbreaks in schools are not often \u201ctrue\u201d outbreaks where infections spread within the school. Instead, many are infections that have taken place outside the school but subsequently associated with the school.\n\nThe probable source of such outbreaks are instead infections within households, where the risk of infection is ten times higher than in schools.\n\nOne US study, which has been released in advance of its final, peer-reviewed version, found that infection rates in schools were considerably lower than infection rates in the wider community.\n\nWhat about adults?\n\nThe current evidence suggests that infections in schools are more likely to have been introduced by adults than children. The spread of infection within schools tends to be between adult staff or adult-to-child rather than between children or from children to adults.\n\nAnother major concern is the health of teachers and other school staff. Data from the UK Office for National Statistics reassuringly indicates that teachers are not at increased risk of infection or death from COVID compared to other occupational groups.\n\nLikewise, investigations from Norway and other countries found no or very little transmission within schools.\n\nSchools reflect the community\n\nAll this means that schools can be made relatively safe with appropriate infection control measures such as face coverings, physical distancing, good hygiene and ventilation.\n\nCrucially, infection levels in children and schools reflect how much transmission is taking place in the wider community. Rather than children and schools being seen as a risk to the community, the opposite applies \u2013 the rate of community spread should be seen as the greatest risk to schools.\n\nThe heightened focus on school closures also distracts from a key fact \u2013 in the UK, 85% of infections occur in adults, most of them those of working age. Children account for fewer than one in six known infections in England.\n\nSo making schools safer means reducing infection levels in the wider adult population, not the other way round. And targeting resources at children who are likely to be less potent infection spreaders may well be an ineffective use of resources.\n\nA measure of last resort\n\nOverall, there remains uncertainty about just how effective school closures are as a pandemic control measure. The evidence base continues to grow and we still need more robust studies on the subject.\n\nWith the emergence of the new variant and skyrocketing infections over winter, it was probably inevitable that schools would be closed in the UK. But now, given that there is no \u201czero-risk\u201d solution to solve the pandemic, decisions about reopening need to involve a close evaluation of the known and potential harms and benefits.\n\nSchool closures might reduce overall community infections by a small amount and may be necessary when infection levels in the population are very high. But they should only really be implemented as a last resort as part of wider pandemic control measures and should not be undertaken lightly."

          "title": "Voyage Around My Room: lessons on marvelling at the minutiae of our homes in isolation",
          "text": "For those struggling with lockdown, an anti-travel book written in 1790 offers unlikely solace. Written while under house arrest in Turin, Italy, Xavier de Maistre\u2019s Voyage Around My Room is an undervalued travelogue. De Maistre describes his travels in miniature with the enchantment of the Grand Tour: a few paces around the bed, a longing gaze at an engraving, and on to the armchair:\n\nMy room is situated in latitude 48\u00b0 east, according to the measurement of Father Beccaria. It lies east and west, and, if you keep very close to the wall, it forms a parallelogram of 36 steps round. My journey will, however, be longer than this; for I shall traverse my room up and down and across, without rule or plan.\n\nI stumbled across Voyage Around My Room in philosopher Alain de Botton\u2019s The Art of Travel, a quizzical appraisal of travel writing. De Botton weighs Voyage against Alexander von Humboldt\u2019s 30-volume Travels to the Equinoctial Regions, a magnum opus of scientific and geographical exploration. Where von Humboldt braves rapids, scales peaks and wrestles electric eels, de Maistre stays in his room with insouciant aplomb. Von Humboldt longed \u201cto be transported from a boring daily life to a marvellous world\u201d. De Maistre\u2019s insight, conversely, is that within life\u2019s boredoms greater marvels may be discovered.\n\nWith wry sideswipes at the grandiosity of travel narratives, de Maistre offers vivid lessons for troubled times.\n\nAnti-travel writing\n\nIn his confinement, de Maistre ponders friendship, death, philosophy, and misfortune. He delights in painting and poetry \u2013 and his breakfast. He mocks travel writing\u2019s pedantry, itemising details along the way: furniture, engravings, contents of the bureau.\n\nUpon opening the first drawer to the left, we find an inkstand, paper of all kinds, pens ready mended, and sealing-wax; all which set the most indolent person longing to write.\n\nHis tongue-in-cheek tale nonetheless offers timely lessons, if we have the patience to discern them.\n\nOne reader calls de Maistre \u201ca master of minutiae. Voyage Around My Room is his manifesto for surviving and thriving. Finding his chamber abounds in \"all the riches and enjoyments of the world\u201d, he revels in his constriction. Whenever frustration threatens, he dissolves it with attention to detail.\n\nAuthor provided (No reuse)\n\nExemplifying minimal effort\n\nLockdown initially ignited crazes of mastering skills, learning languages, decluttering, revamping spaces. For those, like me, overwhelmed by such strenuous goals, de Maistre is a patron. He exemplifies minimal effort.\n\nDe Maistre\u2019s style of voyaging also suits all. The poor and rich; the sick and the idle. He admires that \u201ccapital article of furniture\u201d, the armchair; he applauds a good fire, books and pens, immediately forgetting books to stir the fire. He allows his journey to zig-zag like Tristram Shandy\u2019s errant narrative.\n\nI am no admirer of people who are such masters of their every step and every idea that they can say, \u201cTo-morrow I shall make three calls, write four letters, and finish this of that work.\u201d So open is my soul to all sorts of ideas, tastes and feelings.\n\nWithout Zoom, de Maistre maintains contact with the world through his long-suffering valet. He takes care to be mindful that, with such reduced human contact, he is escaping the fickle judgements of the world: \u201cThe pleasure to be found in travelling around one\u2019s room is sheltered from the restless jealousy of men, and is independent of Fortune.\u201d We might benefit from recasting lockdown as an opportunity to switch off from feeling judged by others. If nobody is dressing up, going out, having a better time than us, then we may forget, for a while, the latest fashions and cars, jostling for status and exchanging gossip.\n\nTo those who may not travel, Voyage Around my Room offers alternative explorations. We are all making such voyages perforce, equipped only with our pyjamas and capacity for noticing. If surviving in cramped circumstances seemed challenge enough, de Maistre\u2019s wry counsel turns isolation into expedition. Consider your furniture; lose your way en route to the armchair; stand idle, indulging in behaviour we\u2019d rather not broadcast away from prying eyes.\n\nVoyage Around My Room shows the weary in lockdown that there is much more to discover on our voyages around our room. Xavier de Maistre was so encouraged by his brother\u2019s reaction to his work that he wrote a sequel, Nocturnal Expedition Around My Room, in which our intrepid author heads for the balcony."

          "title": "No joke: Using humor in class is harder when learning is remote",
          "text": "Most discussions about the drawbacks of online education focus on the negative effects it has on learning. Less obvious \u2013 but also quite important \u2013 is how remote instruction can affect the teacher\u2019s use of humor.\n\nScholars have formulated various explanations for why people use humor. As someone who has helped prepare and provide professional development for prospective and veteran teachers for more than 30 years, I am often asked whether humor is an effective way to teach. Decades of research has left little doubt: The answer is yes. Among other benefits, humor can create a positive learning environment, increase learning and make students more motivated to learn.\n\nNo laughing matter\n\nThe pandemic hasn\u2019t eliminated the benefits of humor in the classroom. Instructors, however, have told me during interviews for this article that it\u2019s more difficult to use humor when their students appear on video screens than in actual classrooms.\n\nAnnette Trierweiler, an assistant professor of environmental science, told me that she used less humor in fall of 2020 because her remote lessons were like \u201cperforming in front of a dead audience.\u201d\n\nI have noticed the same thing in my own online courses. Comments and stories that usually make students laugh when I am in person somehow fall flat when class is online.\n\nThis challenge isn\u2019t new.\n\nPsychology professors Frank LoSchavio and Mark Shatz in 2006 published some of the first research on using humor in online courses. Neither has changed his mind about a key distinction between face-to-face and remote instruction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s generally easier to pull off humor in a traditional classroom,\u201d LoSchavio told me.\n\nAnd that brings us to five reasons humor is harder to pull off when learning is remote.\n\n1. Clues get missed\n\nHumor is primarily social in nature. In other words, it occurs when people interact. For that reason, successful humor depends on people being able to pick up on contextual clues. This includes gestures, facial expressions and posture. It can also involve things such as the pitch, speed and rhythm of a person\u2019s voice. Remote instruction can make it harder to pick up on or make sense of these types of things.\n\nReligion professor Stephen Hearne, who\u2019s been teaching online courses for two decades, complains that body language and other ways to telegraph humor often go unnoticed or unseen on computer screens. According to Hearne, that\u2019s one reason there\u2019s \u201ca better chance students will get more of the humor\u201d in traditional classrooms.\n\n2. Technical problems\n\nThe poor quality of audio and video connections can further distort a teacher\u2019s voice and image, as well as student responses. As Mark Shatz, the psychology professor and author of a book on secrets to writing comedy, puts it, \u201cthe virtual platform removes or minimizes the feedback loop that guides humor selection and delivery.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, cellphones \u2013 with their tiny screens and speakers \u2013 are the preferred or only internet connection for some students. The problem is that words get garbled and gestures are miniaturized beyond recognition on cellular devices.\n\n3. Laughter is less contagious\n\nHumor is social in another respect. We often rely on the subtle and not so subtle reactions of others to confirm if something is funny. That\u2019s not possible when only a few students can or want to be seen during remote instruction. Moreover, hearing someone else laugh can trigger us to smile or laugh ourselves. Television sitcoms use laugh tracks for that very reason: They coax viewers into making desired responses.\n\nThose types of desired responses are often lacking in remote instruction, especially if students have their cameras on mute. Andrew Barnhill, an assistant professor of public service, found that out this fall. \u201cStudents aren\u2019t able to easily feed off of each other\u2019s reactions to comments in the same way that they do in person,\u201d he told me.\n\nOn a related matter, audio delays \u2013 a near universal phenomenon in remote education \u2013 can cause the teacher and students to speak over one another in a jerky start-and-stop rhythm. \u201cThe slight delay that you get over Zoom as opposed to in-person makes a difference,\u201d Barnhill says.\n\n[Insight, in your inbox each day. You can get it with The Conversation\u2019s email newsletter.]\n\n4. When the camera is on, the laughs are off\n\nHumor research provides something else to consider. In one study, participants were overtly or covertly videotaped watching excerpts from popular television comedies. When they were aware of the camera\u2019s presence, they laughed less. In short, the camera\u2019s presence was a big killjoy.\n\nThis might help explain an experience that a Furman University religion professor Bryan Bibb \u2013 a colleague of mine \u2013 recently had. Prior to discussing certain risque double entendres in the Old Testament, Bibb usually plays sexually suggestive excerpts from early blues songs. Typically \u201ca fun and funny moment,\u201d Bibb said that over Zoom \u201cit just felt sort of gross.\u201d\n\nSome students who are conscious of the camera\u2019s seemingly voyeuristic leer \u2013 and self-conscious about how it makes them feel \u2013 turn off their audio and video feeds. This leaves only their names as unresponsive avatars on the teacher\u2019s video screen.\n\nTalk about a tough crowd.\n\n5. Too many distractions\n\nDistractions \u2013 the kryptonite of humor \u2013 are the rule, not the exception, in remote classes. People wander in the background and babies cry in the foreground.\n\nFionnuala Darby Hudgens, a community college English instructor, says that \u201cinterruptions occur during almost every online session.\u201d For her and many others, the most common scene-stealers are kids and pets.\n\nComedian W.C. Fields once observed the same thing, advising people in entertainment to never work with animals or children because they steal attention.\n\nThe last laugh?\n\nTough times and tough crowds aside, it\u2019s too early to give up on humor in remote instruction. The challenge for teachers lies not only in adapting to new technology, but also in understanding what makes something funny in the first place.\n\nHumor can never be reduced to a one-size-fits-all model. More art than science, humor must respond to an ever-changing set of circumstances and personalities, which is the key to its survival. The joke will be on us as teachers if we ever forget that."

          "title": "How the National Prayer Breakfast became an opportunity for presidents and faith leaders alike to push their political agendas",
          "text": "Addressing his first National Prayer Breakfast as president on Feb. 4, Joe Biden spoke of the need to \u201cturn to faith\u201d in a \u201cdark, dark time.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, he called for Americans to \u201cconfront and defeat political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism,\u201d and argued that religion can help America unite as \u201cone nation in a common purpose: to respect one another, to care for one another, [and] to leave no one behind.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s address provided an insight into how Biden plans to navigate the complex relationship between religion and politics in the post-Trump era.\n\nBut it also underlines the importance of the traditional presidential address at the National Prayer Breakfast \u2013 an annual high-profile gathering of faith leaders and politicians held in Washington D.C. on the first Thursday in February since 1953.\n\nThat the annual breakfast draws so much attention marks the fulfillment of a dream by the event\u2019s founder, Abraham Vereide, a Norwegian immigrant and minister born in 1886 who credited the idea to an early morning vision brought about by prayer. As a scholar of U.S. religion and culture, I believe the story of the National Prayer Breakfast provides insight into the complex relationship between religion and politics in the last century.\n\nThe start in the 1930s\n\nVereide came to the U.S. in 1905 and found work as an itinerant Methodist minister. He served as a director of Goodwill Industries in Seattle and spent the first part of his career doing relief work for the poor and needy during the Great Depression. But according to Christian author Norman Percy Grubb\u2019s biography of Vereide, \u201cModern Viking,\u201d he came to feel it was not the \u201cdown and out\u201d but the \u201cup and out\u201d \u2013 wealthy and powerful men who were not particularly religious \u2013 who really needed his attention. Vereide wrote that \u201cthe manpower of the churches had dwindled badly, and politics seemed under the control of those who were not fit to take leadership.\u201d Concerned about the decline of organized religion\u2019s political power and the growing role of the organized labor movement, and convinced that both unions and FDR\u2019s New Deal were \u201csubversive\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d influences in business and politics, he turned to prayer.\n\nOne night in April 1935, Vereide\u2019s prayers yielded what he claimed was a 1:30 a.m. vision and a plan. Later that month he gathered 19 local businessmen for the first Seattle prayer breakfast. The 7:45 a.m. meeting time was chosen so as not to interfere with family and work responsibilities.\n\nIn these initial meetings, the group was primarily concerned with how to combat the local workers\u2019 movement, which they perceived as dangerous and corrupt, and it was restricted to business executives only. But in the process, Vereide realized that these breakfast meetings \u2013 nondenominational, held in secular offices rather than church buildings, and focused on prayer, Bible study and building relationships \u2013 established powerful new networks among the city\u2019s business, political, and religious leaders. Prayer breakfasts became Vereide\u2019s method for reaching powerful elites who could help to advance Christian interests in business and politics.\n\nThe prayer breakfast movement quickly spread to other cities, including Washington, D.C., where the first prayer groups were established in the U.S. House and Senate in 1942 and 1943. In 1943 Vereide founded the National Committee for Christian Leadership, changing its name to International Christian Leadership the following year, to provide coordination for the growing movement. He defined the organization\u2019s purpose as \u201cOne world in active cooperation in commerce, science, labor and education should be one world in spiritual unity and moral convictions.\u201d\n\nVereide attributed the movement\u2019s success to the example of none other than Jesus himself, whose disciples were \u201cmen in the fishing business.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus founded the first breakfast group,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom hesitancy to opportunity\n\nIn 1953, the first Presidential Prayer Breakfast, as it was then called, was held in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., with 400 in attendance. President Dwight Eisenhower initially declined an invitation to attend, but relented with the persuasion of evangelist Billy Graham, and delivered an address about the importance of prayer.\n\nEisenhower remarked that \u201cprayer is just simply a necessity, because by prayer I believe we mean an effort to get in touch with the Infinite.\u201d\n\nSince Eisenhower, every sitting U.S. president has attended the breakfast at least once during his term. The presidential address is only part of the breakfast, a multi-day event. While most presidents have used the address to speak about their personal religious beliefs, at the 2020 breakfast, Donald Trump waved \u201cTrump Acquitted\u201d newspaper headlines and used the opportunity to launch an attack on the religious commitments of his political opponents.\n\nExclusive and elitist?\n\nThe breakfast is still sponsored by the same organization Vereide founded, now known, simply, as The Family, and two members of Congress and a bipartisan committee serve as its honorary hosts.\n\nAfter Vereide\u2019s death in 1969, evangelist and businessman Doug Coe succeeded him in leadership of the organization. Under Coe, who died in 2017, the prayer breakfast continued to grow in influence \u2013 with Coe himself counting high-ranking politicians among his powerful friends.\n\n\u201cThe Family,\u201d a 2019 Netflix series, explored the influence of the organization on American politics. Journalist Jeff Sharlet, whose 2009 book is the basis of the series, says that \u201cThe National Prayer Breakfast is 100% The Family\u2019s event, an event that is meant to be this very public display of power.\u201d\n\nAttendance at the breakfast is by invitation only, and the event has long faced criticism that it is exclusive and elitist. And secularists balk at the way that the event has become a public religious ritual at the center of U.S. government.\n\nSince the Obama era, many non-Christian and secular groups have called on presidents to boycott the breakfast because of concerns over its connections to anti-LGBTQ and right-wing groups. This year, secular advocacy group Americans United called on Biden to \u201cdraw a sharp contrast with his predecessor\u201d by strongly endorsing church-state separation, freedom of religion and religious pluralism.\n\nAs the breakfast has expanded to become an interreligious, international event, now including 4,000 attendees from over 140 countries, it has also become a ready opportunity for networking and deal-making.\n\nAccording to the event registration website, \u201cthe purpose of the National Prayer Breakfast is to gather people from all over the world to pray for our leaders and to walk with them on the path that Jesus sets forth for all of us.\u201d It also claims not to be \u201ca political gathering.\u201d Rather, \u201cmany politicians who come are Jesus-centered leaders who talk about how they collaborate and develop friendships across the aisle.\u201d\n\nBut a 2018 article in The New York Times \u2013 published after the indictment of Maria Butina, a Russian agent who attended the National Prayer Breakfast twice in an effort to set up back-channel meetings between Russian and American officials \u2013 had a different take, calling the event \u201can international influence-peddling bazaar, where foreign dignitaries, religious leaders, diplomats and lobbyists jockey for access to the highest reaches of American power.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s address attempted to address those criticisms without breaking tradition and to cast religion as a unifying, rather than divisive, force in U.S. politics. Since Eisenhower, the breakfast has endured as a presidential tradition, he said, but what it celebrates is something fundamentally beyond partisanship, beyond politics, and beyond any one religious tradition: \u201cA nation \u2026 always in prayer.\u201d\n\n[Deep knowledge, daily.

While I feel sorry for the many investors who will likely lose a lot of money, the stocks\u2019 return to Earth is actually a good thing \u2013 if you want to avoid financial meltdown to the long list of crises the U.S. is facing.\n\nThe reason has to do with what financial markets are \u2013 and what they are not \u2013 as well as what happens when prices of stocks and other securities become untethered from the fundamental value of the assets they\u2019re meant to represent.\n\nAs a finance professor who does research on how markets respond to new information, I believe it is important to maintain a close link between security prices and fundamentals. When that stops happening, a market collapse may be not far behind.\n\nCapital markets aren\u2019t casinos\n\nSome have portrayed GameStop as a David vs. Goliath story. According to that narrative, the big guys on Wall Street have been getting rich gambling on the stock market for years. What\u2019s the problem when the little guy gets a chance?\n\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that markets aren\u2019t a big casino, as some seem to believe. Their core purpose is to efficiently connect investors with companies and other organizations that will make the most productive use of their cash.\n\nAccurate market prices, meant to reflect a company\u2019s expected profits and overall risk level, provide an important signal to investors whether they should hand over their money and what they should get in return. Companies like Apple and Amazon simply would not exist as we know them today without access to capital markets.\n\nThe more jaundiced view of markets focuses on episodes when markets seemingly go crazy and on the speculative gambling behavior of some traders, such as hedge funds. The GameStop saga feeds into this storyline.\n\nBut GameStop also illustrates what happens when stock prices don\u2019t reflect reality.\n\nThe GameStop bubble\n\nGameStop fundamentals are, to put it mildly, lackluster.\n\nThe company is a brick-and-mortar chain of video game stores. Most video game sales now take place as digital downloads. GameStop has been slow to adapt to this new reality. Its revenue peaked in 2012 at US$9.55 billion and had dropped by a third as of 2019. It hasn\u2019t earned a profit since 2017. Put simply, it is a money-losing company in a competitive and quickly changing industry.\n\nThe recent speculative frenzy, however, increased the GameStop stock price from under $20 in early January to as high as $483 in a little over two weeks, driven by retail investors on Reddit who coordinated their buying to harm hedge funds \u2013 costing the professionals billions of dollars.\n\nIt is clearly a speculative price bubble and has some characteristics of a Ponzi scheme. Many small investors who \u201cget on the train\u201d late and buy at the inflated prices \u2013 especially those attracted by the extreme price moves and media coverage \u2013 will be left holding the bag.\n\nAnd sooner or later, the stock price will likely come back to Earth to a level that can be supported by the fundamentals of the company. Shares closed on Feb. 4 at $53.50, the lowest since Jan. 21.\n\nThe problems begin when that doesn\u2019t happen until too late.\n\nBubbles are made to pop\n\nFinancial markets are made up of people. People are imperfect, and so are markets. This means market prices are not always \u201cright\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s often hard to know what the \u201cright\u201d price is.\n\nThat is true when it comes to the price bubbles in individual stocks like GameStop. But it\u2019s also true on a much bigger scale, when it comes to a market as a whole.\n\nPrice bubbles and crashes are good for neither Wall Street nor Main Street. When the dot-com bubble popped in 2000 \u2013 after prices of dozens of tech stocks soared exponentially in the late 1990s \u2013 an economic recession followed soon after. The bursting of a housing bubble in 2008 triggered a global financial crisis and the Great Recession.\n\nToo much momentum\n\nSo markets fail sometimes, and we need sensible regulation and enforcement to make such failures less likely.\n\nTaken in isolation, the GameStop craze is unlikely to trigger a disruption to the overall stock market, especially if its price continues to fall more in line with the company\u2019s fundamental value. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated case. Nor was GameStop the first sign of problems.\n\nIn recent days, Reddit users have also driven up the prices of silver and companies such as BlackBerry and movie theater giant AMC Entertainment. Popular trading apps like Robinhood have made trading easy, fun and basically free.\n\n[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation\u2019s newsletter.]\n\nThe share price of Tesla, for example, skyrocketed 720% last year, in large part when investors bought the stock because it was already rising. This is called momentum investing, a trading strategy in which investors buy securities because they are going up \u2013 selling them only when they think the price has peaked.\n\nIf this continues, it will likely lead to more financial bubbles and crashes that could make it harder for companies to raise capital, posing a threat to the already limping U.S. economic recovery. Even if the worst doesn\u2019t happen, large price movements and allegations of price manipulation could hurt public confidence in financial markets, which would make people more reluctant to invest in retirement and other programs.\n\nWarren Buffett once said about stock market behavior: \u201cThe light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow.\u201d\n\nWhat he meant was that markets can turn on a dime and plunge. He saw these moments as opportunities to find deals in the market, but for most people they result in panic, heavy losses and economic consequences like mass unemployment \u2013 as we saw in 1929, 2000 and 2008.\n\nThere\u2019s no particular reason it won\u2019t happen again."

          "title": "North Korea targeted cybersecurity researchers using a blend of hacking and espionage",
          "text": "North Korean hackers have staged an audacious attack targeting cybersecurity researchers, many of whom work to counter hackers from places like North Korea, Russia, China and Iran. The attack involved sophisticated efforts to deceive specific people, which raises the level of social engineering, or phishing attacks, and enters the realm of spy tradecraft.\n\nThe attack, reported by Google researchers, centered on fake social media accounts on platforms including Twitter. The fake personas, posing as ethical hackers, contacted security researchers with offers to collaborate on research. The social media accounts included content about cybersecurity and faked videos purporting to show new cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nThe hackers enticed the researchers to click links to shared code projects \u2013 repositories of software related to cybersecurity research \u2013 that contained malicious code designed to give the hackers access to the researchers\u2019 computers. Several cybersecurity researchers reported that they fell victim to the attack.\n\nFrom phishing to espionage\n\nThe lowest level of social engineering hack is a typical phishing attack: impersonal messages sent to many people in the hopes that someone will be duped into clicking on a malicious link. Phishing attacks have generally been on the rise since early 2020 \u2013 a side effect of the pandemic-driven work-from-home environment in which people are sometimes less vigilant. This is also why ransomware has become prevalent.\n\nThe next level of sophistication is spear-phishing. Here people are targeted with messages that include information that is specific to them or their organizations, which increases the likelihood that someone will click a malicious link.\n\nThe North Korean operation is at a higher level than spear-phishing because it targeted people who are security-minded by the nature of their occupation. This required the hackers to create convincing social media accounts complete with content about cybersecurity, including videos, that could fool cybersecurity researchers.\n\nThe North Korean operation highlights three important trends: stealing cyberweapons from industry, social media as a weapon, and the blurring of cyber and information warfare.\n\n1. Theft of cyberweapons from industry\n\nBefore the North Korean operation, the theft of cyberweapons made headlines at the end of 2020. In particular, December\u2019s FireEye breach resulted in the theft of tools used by ethical hackers. These tools were used to crack the security of corporate clients to show the clients their vulnerabilities.\n\nThis prior incident, attributed to Russia, illustrates how hackers attempted to augment their arsenals of cyberweapons by stealing from a commercial cybersecurity firm. The North Korean action against security researchers shows that they\u2019ve adopted a similar strategy, though with a different tactic.\n\nBack in the fall, the National Security Agency disclosed a list of vulnerabilities \u2013 ways that software and networks can be hacked \u2013 that were exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. Despite these warnings the vulnerabilities have persisted, and information about how to exploit them could be found on social media and the dark web. This information was clear and detailed enough that my company, CYR3CON, was able to use machine learning to predict the use of these vulnerabilities.\n\n2. The weaponization of social media\n\nInformation operations \u2013 collecting information and disseminating disinformation \u2013 on social media have become abundant in recent years, especially those conducted by Russia. This includes using \u201csocial bots\u201d to spread false information. This \u201cpathogenic social media\u201d has been used by national intelligence operatives and ordinary hackers alike.\n\nTraditionally, this type of targeting has been designed to either spread disinformation or entice an executive or high-ranking government employee to click on a malicious link. In contrast, the North Korean operation was aimed at stealing cyberweapons and information about vulnerabilities.\n\n3. The confluence of cyber and information warfare\n\nOutside of the United States \u2013 especially in China and Russia \u2013 cyberoperations are considered part of a broader concept of information warfare. The Russians, in particular, have proved very adept at combining information operations and cyberoperations. Information warfare includes using traditional spy tradecraft \u2013 operatives with false identities attempting to gain the trust of their targets \u2013 to collect and disseminate information.\n\nThe attack against cybersecurity researchers could indicate that North Korea is taking cues from these other powers. The low-cost ability of a second-tier authoritarian regime like North Korea to weaponize social media provides it an advantage against the much greater technical capabilities of the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the North Koreans appear to have used one of their most valuable cyberweapons in this operation. Google reported that it appeared the hackers used a means of exploiting a zero-day vulnerability \u2013 a software flaw that is not widely known \u2013 in Google\u2019s Chrome browser in the attack on the cybersecurity researchers. Once such an exploit is used, people are alerted to defend against it and becomes much less effective.\n\n[The Conversation\u2019s science, health and technology editors pick their favorite stories. Weekly on Wednesdays.]\n\nSetting the stage for something bigger?\n\nIn cybersecurity, big news items tend to be events like the Sunburst operation by Russian hackers in December \u2013 large-scale cyberattacks that cause a great deal of damage. In the Sunburst attack, Russian hackers booby-trapped widely used software, which gave them access to the networks of numerous corporations and government agencies.\n\nThese large events are often proceeded by smaller events in which new techniques are experimented with \u2013 often without making a large impact. While time will tell if this is true of the North Korean operation, the three current trends \u2013 stealing cyberweapons from industry, social media as a weapon, and the blurring of cyber and information warfare \u2013 are harbingers of things to come."

          "title": "Is Labor still the party of initiative in Australian politics?",
          "text": "As Australians try to put the upheavals of past year behind them and warily look ahead into 2021, probably one of the last things they want to contemplate is the prospect of a pugilistic election campaign.\n\nHowever, this August, a 10-month window will open for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call a House of Representatives and half-Senate election. Notwithstanding Morrison\u2019s publicly stated preference to govern for a full three-year term, the guessing game about the timing of the federal election has already begun. There\u2019s speculation about a poll in the spring of 2021. This chatter will only intensify in the coming months, accompanied by phoney campaign posturing.\n\nMore interesting than the timing of the next election is what it is likely to deliver. The blindsiding that was 2020 is a salutary warning against punditry about the future of any kind.\n\nNevertheless, as things currently stand, the Coalition is favoured to retain office when Australians next visit the ballot box. It has a relatively popular prime minister and has been mostly ahead, albeit narrowly, in opinion polls.\n\nThe political effect of COVID-19 has also been to bring incumbency back into vogue. So long as Australia\u2019s record of ably handling the pandemic continues to hold, this will hand the federal government a powerful platform on which to campaign.\n\nWorking to the Coalition\u2019s advantage in addition is a Labor opposition still disorientated by Morrison\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d victory of May 2019. The ALP seems as nonplussed as ever about a finding a formula for speaking simultaneously to workers from the inner cities, suburbs and regions.\n\nRead more: Grattan on Friday: Albanese's reshuffle sharpens focus on 'jobs' but talk about his own job will continue\n\nLet us indulge, then, the scenario of Morrison winning the next election. Victory would extend the Coalition\u2019s spell in office to around a dozen years. This would be the second period of Coalition rule of more than a decade\u2019s duration since John Howard defeated Paul Keating\u2019s Labor government in March 1996.\n\nTo put it another way, Labor would have had just six years in office \u2013 with half of that time spent in minority government \u2013 in a quarter of a century.\n\nViewed in the longer term, a Morrison victory in 2021/2022 would further reinforce the Coalition\u2019s electoral supremacy since the end of the second world war. The Liberal-National parties would have been in office for two-thirds of that 80-year period.\n\nConversely, Labor would have experienced only one extended period of government during that time: the Hawke-Keating era of 1983-96. Indeed, it would underscore that Bob Hawke\u2019s dream of transforming Labor into Australia\u2019s natural party of government has been unfulfilled, with his and Keating\u2019s five consecutive electoral victories an aberration in an otherwise continuing pattern of Coalition dominance.\n\nWhy should this matter? One of the oldest axioms of Australian politics is that Labor is the party of \u201cinitiative\u201d and its opponents the parties of \u201cresistance\u201d. While a generalisation, there is more than a kernel of truth in these categorisations.\n\nLeaving aside the original foundational legislation of the early Commonwealth, which was produced by a combination of Liberal Protectionist and Labor ministries, Labor governments were the architects of the two national macro-policy settlements of last century. The governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley (1941-49) initiated the post-war Keynesian welfarist order. The Hawke-Keating governments instigated the post-Keynesian or market-based economic order (softened by social wage measures).\n\nThe Curtin-Chifley and Hawke-Keating governments were, in other words, regime builders. In turn, the long-run Coalition governments that followed them, led by Robert Menzies and John Howard respectively, were consolidators of the paradigms originated by Labor.\n\nNational Archives of Australia\n\nFurthermore, in between the epochal Labor administrations of the 1940s and 1980s was Gough Whitlam\u2019s government of 1972-75. A powerful modernising force, it pioneered a dizzying array of social and cultural reforms, among them universal healthcare.\n\nThough relatively rare, Labor prime ministerships have been disproportionally significant in their transformational effects. However, the party\u2019s most recent period of national government under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard disappointed in that respect.\n\nWinning office on a small-target program and rapidly alienating colleagues with his imperious leadership style, Rudd\u2019s prime ministership is best remembered for its management of the Global Financial Crisis and the apology to the Stolen Generations. But it left little policy imprint.\n\nGillard\u2019s government ushered in major reforms headed by a price on carbon and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The latter was arguably the most important social reform since universal healthcare. Yet the larger picture of the Rudd-Gillard years was one of debilitating internecine leadership conflict and squandered opportunity.\n\nRead more: Thanks to coronavirus, Scott Morrison will become a significant prime minister\n\nIn fact, the early 21st century has been mostly been a story of policy stasis, whether Labor or the Coalition has been in government. Discredited by the GFC and ill-equipped to meet the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, the neo-liberal era has run out of puff. To date, though, there has been no coherent new settlement between citizen and state.\n\nTo be fair, history suggests transitions between one policy regime and another take time. There is often a lag between one order waning and the emergence of the next. Moreover, Australia is certainly not alone in currently enduring a period of policy ennui and confusion of direction.\n\nLooking forward, however, there is a nagging doubt about whether Labor still possesses the creative capacity to be the party of initiative in Australian politics. At the 2019 election, it campaigned on a broad suite of policies, but lacked the language to describe the sum of those parts.\n\nThe past two years seem only to have deepened the party\u2019s uncertainty about its mission. Again, this is not unprecedented. During the Menzies era, Labor took time to develop a new generation of leaders and ideas. And at least some of the bold reforms of the Hawke-Keating years were a response to contingency rather than forethought.\n\nBurnt by the circumstances of its 2019 defeat, the probability is that Labor will run on a relatively constrained program whenever the next federal election is held. At some point, though, the party will have to answer whether this latest long wait for a Labor government has been worth it."

          "text": "February has already been a bad month for Perth. Bushfire has destroyed 81 homes and burned more than 10,000 hectares northeast of the city. Residents in the midst of a COVID-19 lockdown were told to abandon their homes and seek shelter as the bushfire raged.\n\nThe disaster calls to mind the unprecedented Black Summer fires that devastated eastern Australia last summer. But the tragedies are very different beasts.\n\nObviously, the Black Summer fires were much more widespread, prolonged and lethal than what Western Australia is experiencing. The east coast fires were largely triggered by lightning, while that\u2019s not thought to be the case in the Perth fire. Wind and temperature also played different roles in the two disasters.\n\nSo let\u2019s examine the drivers of the Perth fire, and consider what the rest of Australia can learn as we face a future of worsening bushfires.\n\nAAP Image/Richard Wainwright\n\nAnatomy of a fire\n\nThe fire was first reported at noon on Monday near the town of Wooroloo, on Perth\u2019s fringe. Authorities don\u2019t yet know how it began, but say \u201cno criminality\u201d has been identified.\n\nThe absence of lightning at the time of ignition, and the proximity to residential areas, suggests the fire was accidentally caused by humans. The location of the fire near homes also meant it destroyed property far more quickly than if had begun in a remote area.\n\nFire science breaks fire behaviour into three main components: fuels, topography and weather. And of course, an ignition is needed to set it off.\n\nThe bushfire started in an area of large, privately owned blocks of land. This area mostly consists of scattered trees in grassy paddocks which, in summer, are dry and burn easily. Fences and trees then ignite and winds carry embers forward, starting spot fires.\n\nRead more: Underinsurance is entrenching poverty as the vulnerable are hit hardest by disasters\n\nThe land area now burning is one of the most hilly parts around Perth. Fire spreads faster uphill, and the slopes redirect winds, adding more complexity to fire suppression. The topography and location of the fire on private properties also made fire-fighting access difficult.\n\nWeather played a major role. The fire started during one of Perth\u2019s typical summer easterly wind events, involving strong gusts, high temperatures and low relative humidity. Most bushfires that burn out of control near Perth begin during these events.\n\nTo make matters worse, a tropical low tracking down Australia\u2019s west coast means the windy conditions are expected to last up to six days \u2013 longer than the typical two to three days. This presents a major challenge for emergency response personnel.\n\nThe areas burning today are well known for their bushfire risk. In 2009, a fire outside the town of Toodyay destroyed 38 homes under similar weather conditions.\n\nAAP Image/Supplied by DFES, Evan Collis\n\nHow WA differs to the east coast\n\nAlong Australia\u2019s east coast, the bushfire season can start as early spring and in some parts, extend into autumn. Last summer\u2019s horrific conditions were a combination of long-term drought and an intensely hot, dry spring. In contrast, almost all bushfires in southwestern Australia have historically occurred in the dry summer period.\n\nWestern Australia has more pronounced seasonal rainfall than the eastern states. In particular, the southwest corner of Australia has a Mediterranean-like climate. Every summer is dry, increasing the bushfire risk. In contrast, eastern Australia typically has a wet, humid summer with rain spread throughout the year.\n\nRead more: 'I felt immense grief': one year on from the bushfires, scientists need mental health support\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a conditions have brought much rain to Australia\u2019s east in recent months. Western Australia had some La Ni\u00f1a moisture in November, but winter rain was below-average and the summer has so far been dry.\n\nAnd as southwestern Australia continues to warm and dry under a changing climate, the period of bushfire risk is now getting longer. That means bushfires in spring and autumn will become more common.\n\nAnd the shifting climate will bring make bushfires worse both in the west and across Australia. Bushfires may escape more quickly, burn more intensely, resist control and occur over a greater part of the year. Plants will have drier foliage, further increasing bushfire intensity.\n\nAAP Image/Supplied by DFES, Evan Collis\n\nPreparing for worse fires\n\nBushfire is a part of life in Australia and these tragedies will happen again. Fortunately for Perth residents, there have been no fatalities and minimal injuries so far.\n\nLooking ahead in WA, new bushfire knowledge hubs and university-government collaborations will open important new conversations about the future bushfire risk and its management.\n\nBut we must continue to improve land-use planning, building codes and mitigation strategies to ensure we\u2019re prepared for worse bushfires under climate change.\n\nRead more: Asking people to prepare for fire is pointless if they can't afford to do it. It's time we subsidised fire prevention"

          "title": "4 things about mRNA COVID vaccines researchers still want to find out",
          "text": "The first mRNA vaccines approved for use in humans \u2014 the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 are being rolled out around the world.\n\nThese vaccines deliver mRNA, coated in lipid (fat), into cells. Once inside, your body uses instructions in the mRNA to make SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The immune response protects around 95% of people vaccinated with either vaccine from developing COVID-19.\n\nSuch mRNA vaccines have many benefits. They are quick to design, so once the manufacturing platform is set up, mRNA vaccines can be designed to target different viruses, or variants, very quickly. The vaccine manufacturing is also fully synthetic, and doesn\u2019t rely on living cells like chicken eggs, or cultured cell lines. So this technology is here to stay.\n\nHowever, there are still issues we need to improve on to help make mRNA vaccines become more practical and affordable for the entire world, not just first-world countries. Here are four areas mRNA vaccine researchers are working on.\n\n1. How to make them more stable at higher temperatures\n\nWe know mRNA and its lipid coat is relatively unstable in a fridge or at room temperature. That\u2019s because RNA is more sensitive than DNA to enzymes in the environment that will degrade it.\n\nTo overcome this, researchers are working on testing what happens when different types of additives are included, hoping they will extend the vaccines\u2019 shelf life. These additives have been used in vaccines before and include, for example, small amounts of common sugars.\n\nAnother approach is to freeze-dry mRNA vaccines into a powder for storage. The idea is to then add water to \u201creconstitute\u201d the vaccine powder before injection. California-based company Arcturus is trialling this strategy in a phase III clinical trial in Singapore.\n\nCureVac, which is also developing an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, has already overcome some of these challenges. It has produced a vaccine stable for three months at fridge temperature.\n\nRead more: How mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna work, why they're a breakthrough and why they need to be kept so cold\n\n2. How to reduce the amount of vaccine in each shot\n\nThe current mRNA vaccine doses range from 30 micrograms (Pfizer/BioNTech) to 100 micrograms (Moderna). In phase I clinical trials, lower doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were also active.\n\nCould we go lower than this? CureVac has developed a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine with a dose of 12 micrograms through a combination of innovations in mRNA sequence and lipid formulations. However, the details of this remain proprietary.\n\nSelf-amplifying mRNA is another approach to reduce vaccine doses. Self-amplifying mRNA is engineered to make more copies of itself once delivered into cells. This means only a small initial dose is needed.\n\nResearchers at Imperial College London and Arcturus are using this method to develop COVID-19 vaccines, although trials have only recently completed phase I stage.\n\nWhile more research will be needed to understand self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, this could reduce costs, as less material is needed.\n\nRead more: Not sure about the Pfizer vaccine, now it's been approved in Australia? You can scratch these 4 concerns straight off your list\n\n3. How to switch from two doses to one\n\nCurrent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines need \u201cboosting\u201d. This is where the first injection primes the immune system, then a second one, three to four weeks later, boosts the immune response.\n\nIt would be much simpler if a single shot could give the same efficacy. And if COVID-19 remains with us, in the future we will need to boost the immune response regularly, such as with yearly flu vaccines.\n\nIn this case, a once-a-year booster shot will be a single injection, rather than the current strategy.\n\nRead more: Why it takes 2 shots to make mRNA vaccines do their antibody-creating best \u2013 and what the data shows on delaying the booster dose\n\nAgain, self-amplifying mRNA may be useful. Arcturus announced encouraging results from a single injection of a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine.\n\nIn research involving mice, posted online but not yet formally published in a journal, a single injection of a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine showed a robust immune response.\n\nAnother approach was developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for protein vaccines. This uses micro-spheres of polymer that can release the vaccine into the body at day one and day 21. This could \u201cboost\u201d in a single injection. A similar micro-sphere approach could be used with mRNA vaccines.\n\n4. How to keep ahead of viral variants and have boosters ready\n\nWe know mRNA vaccine technology is well suited to rapidly responding to emerging viral variants. That\u2019s because the chemical and physical properties of mRNA remain the same, even with small sequence changes required to match viral mutants. This means making modified mRNA vaccines for mutants is quick and simple.\n\nThe main hurdle for a varied sequence will be regulatory approval. However, in a recent interview, the US Food and Drug Administration suggested mRNA vaccines against mutated versions may be accepted with a small clinical trial (or no trials for future mutations). We don\u2019t know if Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration will take a similar approach."

          "text": "Rosaleen Norton, or \u201cthe witch of Kings Cross,\u201d is finally receiving the attention she deserves. Born in Dunedin in 1917, emigrating with her family to Sydney in 1925, and dying in 1979, Norton was a trailblazing woman and under-appreciated cultural touchstone of 20th century Australia.\n\nA self proclaimed witch, Norton experienced childhood visions. From around the age of 23, she practised trance magic and, later, sex magic in various flats and squats in inner-city Sydney.\n\nTrance magic involved Norton meditating (sometimes with the assistance of various substances, ingested and/or inhaled) and raising her consciousness. The aim was to transcend her physical body and conscious mind to experience higher forms of existence.\n\nSex magic was developed by the infamous occultist, Aleister Crowley around 1904, and involves a complicated series of sexual rituals designed for a variety of perceived needs (depending on the practitioner), including spiritual awakening.\n\nBlack Jelly Films, courtesy Burgess Family\n\nAs an artist, Norton drew and painted her beliefs and the gods, goddesses, and spiritual beings who were central to it. She also lived free from societal expectations. Not only a witch, but openly bisexual, Norton robustly challenged a predominantly Christian Australia. But she was reviled for doing so, attacked by the media for her art, her beliefs, her lifestyle, and sometimes, her appearance. She experienced police surveillance and faced obscenity charges over her art.\n\nNorton defied cultural norms and, though she did not identify as a feminist, was a powerfully unconventional woman. Poor but not without imaginative style, she had distinctive arched eyebrows, sometimes dressed in male attire, and was often photographed wearing all black. With a new film about her life being released next week, it is timely to look at her legacy.\n\nFreedom and creativity\n\nNorton\u2019s story has fascinated me from the age of five, when I began to devour the 1970s tabloid newspapers and magazines that featured her. During those years, Norton had become something of a recluse, rarely appearing in public but graciously agreeing to be interviewed about her life. By this time, the legend of \u201cthe witch of Kings Cross\u201d was entrenched. Norton was not averse to it, even donning a pointed hat for photos.\n\nThis passionate interest went on to inform my adult life. As a classicist, I have explored Norton\u2019s occult belief system, which embraced the old gods. Beings such as Hecate, an ancient Greek goddess who presided over witches, Lilith, the ancient female demon originating in Mesopotamia, and the Egyptian goddess Isis, were at the heart of Norton\u2019s magical practice.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nBut the Greek god Pan was at the centre of her pantheon. To the ancient Greeks, Pan was the god of nature, regularly associated with pastureland and its human and animal inhabitants.\n\nHalf-man, half-goat, Pan also embodied the sexual drive, the uninhibited urge to copulate. As the \u201cHigh Priestess at the Altar of Pan\u201d, Norton performed rituals both alone and with members of her inner magical circle in his honour.\n\nIn my own research, I have studied witchcraft through the ages and how, especially from Victorian times, it provided an outlet for unconventional women to leverage freedom (and sometimes power) and express their creativity. (Even as a child, I baulked at the media\u2019s determination to cast Norton as a woman to be judged, feared or, worse still, mocked.)\n\nRead more: Toil and trouble: the myth of the witch is no myth at all\n\nAs an academic, I extended my research into the worlds of Greece and Rome with a focus on sexual histories and belief systems \u2014 and explored Norton\u2019s life through the same lens. Along the way, I acquired enough material to donate a personal archive on Norton to the library at The University of Newcastle.\n\nNorton\u2019s identity as a witch was formed early. As a child, she was drawn to the night, to nature, and to drawing and recording the preternatural world. In an article published in Australasian Post in January 1957, she describes visions from the age of five (a lady in a grey dress, a dragon) and trance states (which she called \u201cBig Things and Little Things\u201d) to capture the experience of her body growing in size as she \u201cfloated,\u201d as if in a dream. She also records the appearance of \u201cwitch marks\u201d on her left knee when she was seven (in the form of two small, blue dots).\n\nBored and frustrated by her middle-class life in Lindfield on the North Shore, Norton left home for inner-city Sydney at the age of 17 and never returned. She found employment as an artist model (including a stint modelling for Norman Lindsay), a pavement artist, and as a contributor to the avant-garde publication, Pertinent.\n\nEventually, she based herself in Kings Cross. There, she was free to explore and develop her beliefs and practices. In the late 1940s, it was where she met one of her companions in life and magic, the poet Gavin Greenlees (1930-1983).\n\nSydney Morning Herald\n\nStrands of magic\n\nNorton and Greenlees practised several strands of magic, including trance magic, sex magic, and ceremonies combining and improvising elements from several traditions. These included Kundalini (the feminine, creative force of infinite wisdom that \u201clives\u201d inside us, usually represented by a snake) and Tantra (encompassing esoteric rituals and practices from Hindu and Buddhist traditions).\n\nNorton explained that she employed these practices to augment her unconscious, inspire and empower her art, and commune with entities on other planes.\n\nNorton\u2019s trance magic, in states of self-hypnosis, was a continuation of her childhood visions and visitations. In correspondence with a psychologist in 1949, she described experiencing deities and projecting her astral body to contact other practitioners in alternative spiritual spheres. The idea, she wrote, was \u201cto induce an abnormal state of consciousness and manifest the results, if any, in drawing\u201d.\n\nRead more: A murky cauldron \u2013 modern witchcraft and the spell on Trump\n\nThese experiences informed and inspired her art. Norton\u2019s paintings were produced for her own ritual spaces, as well as for exhibitions and publications. In a well-known photograph from the 1950s, Norton is shown crouching at the base of her altar to Pan, replete with a large portrait of the god.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald/Black Jelly Films\n\nPan features in many other works. As Norton said in 1957, his \u201cpipes are a symbol of magic and mystery\u201d, while his \u201chorns and hooves stand for natural energies and fleet-footed freedom\u201d.\n\nNorton\u2019s worship of Pan reflected her passion for animals, insects and nature in general. While she did not publicly campaign for animal rights, she was, in some respects, a forerunner of the movement. Regularly the target of outrageous media allegations, she was particularly incensed when asked whether, as a witch, she performed animal sacrifice.\n\nIn 1954, 89.4% of the Australian population identified as Christian. Unfortunately for Norton, the ancient Greek god Pan also resembles Christian representations of Satan or the Devil. Indeed with his goat legs, pointed ears, and lascivious face, Pan most likely inspired early Christian images of Satan. Norton was regularly asked whether she was a Satanist. She wasn\u2019t. But, accusations of Satanism haunted her.\n\nJournalists accused her of Devil worship, police occasionally placed her and Greenlees under surveillance, and her private life became fair game. By the 1950s, the tabloid press\u2019 preferred name for Norton \u2014 \u201cthe witch of Kings Cross\u201d \u2014 had stuck. It featured in news stories on her even after her death.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph/Black Jelly Films\n\nCensorship and court proceedings\n\nNorton\u2019s run-ins with authorities are partly what make her such an important historical figure. Her early exhibitions were subject to media attention and sensationalism, censorship and court proceedings. During an exhibition of her art at Rowden-White Library, University of Melbourne, in 1949, the Vice Squad seized several works deemed to be profane. Norton appeared in court on obscenity charges \u2014 the first such case against a woman in Victoria.\n\nWhile Norton was acquitted, more scandals erupted. Her collaboration with Greenlees on a book titled, The Art of Rosaleen Norton, with poems by Gavin Greenlees, published privately by Walter Glover in 1952, landed Glover and printer, Tonecraft Pty Ltd, in court on charges of producing an obscene publication.\n\nBlack Jelly Films, courtesy Burgess Family\n\nGlover was fined \u00a35 and Tonecraft \u00a31. The book was subject to a customs ban (copies sent to New York were confiscated and burnt by United States Customs) and it became a prohibited import to Australia.\n\nNorton\u2019s Fohat (one of the book\u2019s notorious images) was a representation of her beliefs. The goat, she said, \u201cis a symbol of energy and creativity: the serpent of elemental force and eternity\u201d. As with the images of Pan (and many other artworks), the meaning behind Fohat was misconstrued, deemed obscene and Satanic.\n\nThe case of Sir Eugene Goossens\n\nNorton\u2019s practice of sex magic was at the centre of one sensational court case. Her private rituals concerning the practice (including, among other acts, anal and oral sex, and sado-masochism) involved a discrete group of devotees. One of them was the revered composer and conductor Sir Eugene Goossens (1893-1962).\n\nAs director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium and chief conductor of the ABC\u2019s Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the English-born Goossens was a cultural and social giant in a still very parochial Australia. Having seen a copy of the infamous book by Norton and Greenlees, Goossens sought out the couple and soon became part of their occult practices and personal lives.\n\nCaught up in their world, Goossens became an unsuspecting target of police surveillance. In March 1956, returning from an overseas trip, he was confronted with officers waiting to search his luggage and subsequently charged with importing prohibited items, allegedly including \u201cindecent works and articles, namely a number of books, prints and photographs, and a quantity of film\u201d.\n\nGoossens was besieged day and night at his home, and newspapers screamed headlines, such as \u201cBIG NAMES IN DEVIL RITE PROBE\u201d.\n\nNews Ltd\n\nGoossens\u2019 life and career were ruined. He pleaded guilty to pornography charges in absentia at a hearing in Martin Place Court of Petty Sessions, was fined \u00a3100, and returned to the United Kingdom a broken man.\n\nWhile the media and some biographers of Goossens still tend to blame Norton for contaminating him by inducting him into her unholy cult of sex magic, this could not be further from the truth.\n\nIn fact, Goossens came to Australia with significant experience in occult practices, actively seeking out Norton and Greenlees. Personal correspondence from Goossens to Norton reveals his role in mentoring his new friends in more advanced magic, and hints at a network of practitioners in the UK and Europe. Three of the extant letters are signed with Goossens\u2019 magical name, \u201cDjinn\u201d.\n\nLater life\n\nNorton retired from public view during the 1970s, living in a basement flat in Roslyn Garden, with her sister, Cecily Boothman (1905-1991), close by in the same apartment block. Frail, in poor health, but an artist and witch to the end, Norton practised her rituals, painted and communed with animals and nature.\n\nBlack Jelly Films, courtesy Burgess Family\n\nShe and Boothman were visited by Greenlees on his days of temporary release from the Alma Mater Nursing Home, Kensington, where he had been sectioned after a lengthy stay at Callan Park Mental Hospital at the age of 25.\n\nAt the age of 61, Norton was diagnosed with colon cancer. She died at the Sacred Heart Hospice for the Dying, in Darlinghurst, on 5 December 1979.\n\nNorton has been the subject of biographies by Nevill Drury, a fictionalised account, Pagan, by Inez Baranay, and several plays (including a student production, on which I was dramaturg).\n\nRare footage also captures her at her rebellious best: ensconced in a Kings Cross cafe, talking about rejecting the ordinary life of wife and mother, the thought of which prompts her to say: \u201cI\u2019d go mad\u201d.\n\nNorton was more than a witch. When we look closer at a woman reviled by the media, we see a groundbreaking bohemian, committed to living freely and authentically, who challenged censorship.\n\nIn many ways, she helped to push Australia out of the safety of the Menzies era, into the civilising forces of the sexual revolution and the freedoms it brought.\n\nThe Witch of Kings Cross, written and directed by Sonia Bible, will be released on Amazon, iTunes, Vimeo and GooglePlay on 9th February and opens in selected cinemas from February 11."

          "title": "Environmental change may have played a role at the dawn of Egyptian history \u2013 here\u2019s how",
          "text": "Around 5,000 years ago (c. 3100 BC), what we know today as Ancient Egypt came into existence. A thousand years either side, and other such \u201cprimary states\u201d had also arisen across the world, in Mesopotamia, North China, the Indus Valley and other locations.\n\nBut why did human social dynamics change so dramatically in such a relatively short space of time? Why did we stop living in smaller communities and come together into cities and \u201ccivilisations\u201d?\n\nIn trying to answer this perennial question, archaeologists and anthropologists have historically studied the emergence of social stratification, notions of kingship, shifting identities, changing technologies, and much else. However, these studies \u2013 while looking in detail at these \u201chuman factors\u201d \u2013 have arguably overlooked the changing environment within which the people were interacting, just at the crucial juncture. It is almost as if we have been so focused on the \u201cactors\u201d of the narrative, we have missed the \u201cstage.\u201d\n\nOur research recognises this omission, and has sought to integrate the changing landscapes \u2013 the stage \u2013 into the discussion, recognising that actors\u2019 choices may be influenced by the theatre or set.\n\nSo what did the \u201cstage\u201d look like for the emergence of Ancient Egypt, or indeed any of these other areas in which the first \u201ccivilisations\u201d arose?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, until very recently, we really didn\u2019t know.\n\nTo find out, you have to dig. For every metre you drill down into the silts of the Nile Delta, you delve about a thousand years into the past. If you then study the layers of sand and mud at that depth you can begin to piece together a picture of the landscapes from the past.\n\nSo, if you drill lots of boreholes all over the delta (2-10m deep), study the layers of sand and mud that come up in each one, you can then produce a whole series of maps showing how the delta as a whole looked at different times.\n\nFrom various such drilling programmes we are now beginning to understand that in the Nile Delta the landscapes were changing dramatically just as the people here and upstream were beginning to reorganise their social structures. Intriguingly, very similar environmental changes were also taking place in Mesopotamia and North China (other locations where the world\u2019s first state societies emerged).\n\nFurthermore, these shifts in the landscape were not driven by people, but by an external factor: the slowing-down and stabilisation of post-glacial sea level rise. The \u201cstage\u201d of the theatre upon which the human story played out was indeed evolving by itself, with a natural, inescapable, worldwide driver as the cause.\n\nMud to monuments\n\nBut what were these landscape changes? And could they have nudged the \u201cactors\u201d one way or another? Did they contribute in any way to the emergence of Ancient Egypt?\n\nAnswering the first question is easy: the environments ultimately became less swampy. As sea-level stabilised, rivers started to behave differently. The landscapes gradually evolved from a network of small, dynamic streams criss-crossing a vast expanse of marshland into wider, more open, well-drained floodplains.\n\nAnswering the other questions \u2013 establishing if and how these changes impacted on the trajectory of human history \u2013 is much harder.\n\nOne way we can attempt this is by studying how people interacted with the environment to source their most basic of needs: food.\n\nIf you analyse the environment in this way, it (perhaps counter-intuitively) turns out the earlier, marshy environments were a great place for people to live. There were plenty of very varied food resources in these extraordinarily rich environments. Of course, you couldn\u2019t farm much very easily, but you could happily fish, hunt, keep a few animals and move around in this veritable \u201cEden\u201d and it would have provided for a large population.\n\nBut, as the environment changed \u2013 as the \u201cstage\u201d evolved \u2013 the Nile Delta gradually became much less rich in these wild food resources. Over a few hundred years we can calculate that the delta would have lost some 45% of its primary productivity (food potential). Each succeeding generation would have had a slightly harder job of supporting itself.\n\nThe obvious solution was to increase the takeup of farming. Farming is an extraordinarily efficient invention for maximising the amount of food you can get from a given patch of land. Making the shift would have been easy over a few generations \u2013 the inhabitants of the delta were in frequent contact with other societies that were farming wheat, barley, pigs and cattle, and they could have simply copied.\n\nThis is exactly what we see in the archaeological record. When we analyse what people were eating in this area between 4000-3000 BC it appears that in the swampy landscapes the inhabitants of the delta fished for their food. In the later landscapes they kept pigs and grew more crops. We can even calculate that this shift would have produced a food surplus.\n\nSo it does appear that the landscape changes may have facilitated the inhabitants of the delta farming more through the fourth millennium BC.\n\nBut what was special about this? Plenty of societies have taken up farming in a big way over the last ten thousand years, yet \u201ccivilisations\u201d did not emerge everywhere.\n\nPerhaps the answer has something to do with the vast size of the Nile Delta, coupled with what was happening upstream. The agricultural potential of the delta was at least 40% larger than the whole of the rest of Egypt (which by this time was a collection of rival \u201cproto-kingdoms\u201d). Any of the local upstream leaders who wanted control over their rivals would have realised that the economic key to power lay in controlling the vast output of the newly agricultural, highly fertile delta, just downstream. The delta\u2019s economic surplus ultimately needed to be brought into the network of a new territorial \u201cstate\u201d structure.\n\nOnce again, this is what we see in the archaeological record. In a short space of time, around 3100 BC, the delta\u2019s surplus was brought under control of the world\u2019s first \u201cnation state\u201d \u2013 perhaps even set up in part for that purpose. Early hieroglyphics from this time record transactions into and out of the state treasury, while the \u201ccapital\u201d and royal court were set up at the obvious place \u2013 near modern-day Cairo \u2013 binding the agricultural powerhouse of the delta with the older centres of culture upstream.\n\nParallels\n\nSo it seems that the natural landscape changes in the Nile Delta may have not only helped stimulate local take up of farming technologies, but might also have played a role in the emergence of the first \u201cnation state\u201d. Broadly similar parallels can be tantalisingly drawn up for Mesopotamia and North China \u2013 areas with similar geographies, landscape histories, shifts away from fishing and towards farming, and socio-cultural trends.\n\nWhether such trends are evident in these other settings requires more detailed study. But in doing this we must remember not only to focus on the archaeological record of sites and settlements, but also to look at the changing landscapes. History is not complete without geography. There are ultimately no actors without a stage, and when the stage changes, actors may behave differently."

          "title": "\u2018Building back better\u2019 may seem like a noble idea. But caution is needed",
          "text": "The phrase \u201cbuilding back better\u201d has been prominent in calls for a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It invokes the opportunity to use the disruption to rethink our ways of organising societies and communities. And to use the recovery effort to channel investments towards more inclusive, resilient and environmentally friendly outcomes.\n\nAn increasingly diverse array of actors in different parts of the world have been using the phrase. US President Joe Biden made \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d the leitmotif of his election campaign and his transition into the White House. A plethora of agencies and think-tanks are proposing ways of \u201cbuilding back better\u201d during the pandemic. These range from the British Academy to the World Bank and even a coalition of corporate CEOs. Meanwhile, civil society activists around the world connect the phrase to Arundhati Roy\u2019s description of the pandemic as \u201ca portal, a gateway between one world and the next\u201d.\n\nBut hidden in these various invocations are likely disparate visions of what \u201cbetter\u201d actually means and how to achieve it. Also, there may be a need to reconsider whether a crisis is indeed a good time to implement potentially far-reaching changes.\n\nIn a recently published paper I outline the opportunities and risks associated with ambitions to \u201cbuild back better\u201d at this point in time.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nThe phrase \u201cbuilding back better\u201d entered the lexicon of policymakers, aid workers and scholars in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, though its basic idea has been around much longer. Since then, numerous articles have sought to define the term, provide empirical analyses and make recommendations.\n\nThey show that building back better \u201cis quite challenging to implement in practice\u201d and it may involve diverse emphases or dimensions. There are both opportunities and risks.\n\nFirst to the opportunities.\n\nBuilding in the current context of the pandemic refers to broader, more intangible public benefits, such as public health and welfare systems. Governments\u2019 expansion of public health infrastructure in response to the virus may have longer term benefits, and it makes sense to identify those synergies and invest in them.\n\nAnother domain of public sector policy innovation is in welfare. The pandemic has shown that societies without effective social welfare systems are not only more susceptible to greater humanitarian and social fallout during crises. They are also more vulnerable to the spread of disease, as people without adequate sick leave or medical and unemployment insurance are more likely to go to work despite feeling unwell.\n\nThere is thus a growing recognition of social welfare as a kind of \u201csocial immune system\u201d. This has reinvigorated debates about a basic income grant. It is also highlighting the importance of local community activism in not only responding to immediate public health and welfare needs, but also in longer-term social innovation.\n\nNow to the risks.\n\nThe first revolves around timing. The period following a disaster may not be the best time \u2013 morally and practically \u2013 to attempt longer term social change, given that many people have immediate needs. There may thus be a tension between the fairness principle and the need to channel support to the most vulnerable, on the one hand, and the longer term view encased in \u201cbuild back better\u201d ambitions, on the other.\n\nAlso, psychologists point out that individual and collective decision-making capabilities are challenged in times of stress. We are more likely to make judgments and decisions based on pre-existing biases when we are under pressure.\n\nAn example was the Sri Lankan government\u2019s decision to establish a 200-metre \u201cbuffer zone\u201d along the coast after the 2004 tsunami. But instead of protecting people it had the effect of displacing poor fishers and small, informal traders from their traditional locations adjacent to the beach. Some of this may be explained as a form of \u201cdisaster capitalism\u201d, where elites make intentional use of a crisis to displace local people for their own benefit.\n\nMy own research in Sri Lanka suggested that unintentional biases also played a role. The buffer zone fiasco showed how, in a crisis, decision makers are prone to rash and unsubstantiated decisions based on pre-existing biases, which, as in this case, include a bias among government and business leaders against informal economic activity. The resulting interventions have clear \u201closers\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s different this time\n\nThe current crisis has at least four important, interrelated characteristics that make it notably different from previous disasters evoking the call to \u201cbuild back better\u201d.\n\nIt is not a physical disaster, but about public health and socioeconomic contraction. The physical aspects of actually building back better do not apply. The phrase is thus used in an even more metaphorical way, which could further increase the risks of vacuity, bias, or even intentional misdirection.\n\nThe pandemic is not a short and sudden event, but a drawn-out crisis involving cascading and interlinked disruptions. The challenge of balancing tensions between short-term relief and longer-term objectives are acute, and they are further complicated by profound uncertainties surrounding the trajectory of the disease.\n\nCOVID-19 has a global geographic scope and affects everybody, though in unequal ways. Thus, while disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes or fires normally affect particular regions that can then receive targeted assistance from national governments or even global relief efforts, COVID-19 is affecting all countries and this constrains the support given to especially vulnerable regions or groups.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic involves interlinked health, economic and social crises. It thus creates an especially complex and intersectional set of difficulties. This means that people who invoke \u201cbuilding back better\u201d may either focus on one particular aspect of the crisis, or attempt to tackle a bewilderingly complex set of interactions across natural, social and economic systems. Either of these strategies creates risks of oversimplification, bias and unintended consequences.\n\nCaution required\n\nThe phrase \u201cbuilding back better\u201d should be used with caution. Different people will have different views of what \u201cbetter\u201d actually means and how to achieve it. Crisis situations exacerbate our tendency to emphasise pre-established templates for action and to succumb to biases, such as the all-too-common bias against informal economic activity.\n\nBut this does not mean that we should give up on the basic aspiration invoked by the phrase. The essential requirement is to explicate and discuss the underlying tensions and synergies between short- and long-term objectives, as well as the assumptions we hold around what we consider to be \u201cbetter\u201d and how to achieve it.\n\nKey criteria by which to assess such assumptions and plans include fairness and inclusion, in that the needs, interests, and participation of the poor and vulnerable need to be prioritised."

          "title": "Ghanaians are eating more fast food: the who and the why",
          "text": "Fast food \u2013 food sold in an outlet, drive-through, or restaurant either as preheated or precooked, and served or packaged as take-away \u2013 is ubiquitous in developed countries. For instance, in the US, 45% of adults between the ages of 20 and 39 years and 37.7% of those between the ages of 40 and 59 consume fast food daily. Over 40% of higher-income earners eat fast food on a given day, 36.4% of middle-income, and 31.7% of lower-income earners.\n\nOver the past two decades fast food brands have expanded to many developing countries. Across Africa fast food restaurants have spread at a rapid rate, driven by rising income levels, rapid urbanisation and changing eating habits and lifestyles.\n\nIn Ghana the restaurant sector represents the largest and fastest growing part of the domestic economy, increasing at an annual rate of 20%. Alongside foreign brands, there has also been expansion of informal fast food outlets that sell fried and jollof rice with fried chicken on the streets of many urban areas in Ghana.\n\nIn our research we set out to analyse the social and demographic characteristics of fast food consumers in Ghana. We also examined the cultural and health implications of emerging fast food culture. Our study was based substantially on a review of existing research on fast food in Ghana.\n\nOur aim was to help create awareness about the implications of emerging fast food culture in Ghana.\n\nWho are the consumers of fast food in Ghana?\n\nWe reviewed literature on the demographics of consumers of fast food in Ghana. The literature we reviewed showed that young adults \u2013 15 to 45 years \u2013 were the biggest consumers of fast food in Ghana.\n\nOur review also found that more men consumed fast food than women because men do not often cook or lack basic cooking skills. Although more men than women eat in fast food restaurants, women are increasingly patronising fast food restaurants as traditional gender perceptions are changing.\n\nIt is important to note that eating out is not new in Ghana. But the proliferation of fast food restaurants in recent years has reinforced the habit.\n\nFinally, the literature we reviewed showed that it was mostly unmarried or single men and women that frequently visit fast food restaurants.\n\nWe found that consuming fast food is also a display of social status. Internationally branded fast foods are expensive in Ghana which means that they are consumed by middle and high-income classes. For some Ghanaians, consuming fast food means identifying with Western culture. It also means identifying with modern ways of life.\n\nWe found that fast food brands played on long-held beliefs in which Ghanaians largely associate fast food with Western culture to capture the affluent class who want to display their wealth by consuming fast food.\n\nWe also reviewed literature on the health implications of fast food in Ghana. The literature around the health implications is unequivocal. The consumption of energy-dense and fatty fast food, alongside sedentary lifestyles, poses severe health risks to consumers. Studies show that obesity, diabetes and hypertension as well as other diet-related diseases are on the rise in urban Ghana.\n\nIn a 2012 report Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Health stated that about 48% of Ghanaian adults had hypertension and that it is prevalent among higher income groups. It is therefore not surprising that hypertension is the number-one killer disease in Ghana.\n\nWhat next\n\nWe concluded that the proliferation of fast food restaurants in Ghana is set to continue, and that the increasing consumption of fast food by local elites will undermine the local food culture. This, in turn, will pose severe health challenges to the public.\n\nWe also anticipate that poor people will increasingly turn to fast foods as prices go down because of competition. This means that the health risks will increasingly affect poor people too.\n\nWe argue that it\u2019s imperative that public health policies should be directed towards giving health and nutrition information about fast food to the public. There is also an urgent need to increase public pressure to demand fast food restaurants in Ghana offer healthier options.\n\nThe health effects of COVID-19 have heightened the urgency to adopt healthier food and lifestyle practices to prevent noncommunicable diseases. This is because people with certain underlying medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure are at increased risk of severe illness and even death from COVID-19.\n\nReflecting the worrying trend, the president of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, in the state of the nation address delivered on February 20, 2020 reiterated that obesity has become a serious public health concern due to the food Ghanaians eat as well as lack of physical exercise.\n\nThis article was co-authored with Rebecca Sarku and Jacob Obodai, PhD researchers, Wageningen University and Research, The Netherlands and The Open University, UK, respectively."

          "title": "Conflating morality and the law does South Africa\u2019s governing party no good",
          "text": "Since the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in South Africa in 1994, it has been dogged by corruption and abuse of power.\n\nThese \u201csins of incumbency\u201d \u2013 the seduction of politicians and public officials by power and their abuse of it for their own ends \u2013 became endemic during former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s term (May 2009 to February 2018).\n\nThe details coming out of the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture have shown how deeply this has taken root. Can the governing party dig it out?\n\nThe ANC passed a resolution on how to deal with dishonesty in its ranks at its 54th national conference in December 2017.\n\nIt resolved that any of its cadres \u201caccused of, or reported to be involved in, corrupt practices are to account to the Integrity Committee immediately or face disciplinary processes\u201d.\n\nIt added that those\n\nwho fail to give an acceptable explanation or to voluntarily step down while they face disciplinary, investigative or prosecutorial procedures were to be summarily suspended.\n\nThe party\u2019s integrity commission was established in 2013 to be the custodian of this moral stance, after a series of scandals that damaged its public image.\n\nOn a path to political morality?\n\nThis, followed by the adoption of the anti-corruption resolution and election of Cyril Ramaphosa as president of the ANC, and of the country, created optimism that, finally, the party was set to mend its ways.\n\nThat was easier said than done.\n\nThree years later, the resolution is embroiled in controversies, pitting the ANC\u2019s factions against each other. The biggest test came last November, when the party\u2019s secretary general, Ace Magashule, was charged with corruption and appeared in court.\n\nHe defied the integrity commission\u2019s call on him to step aside, insisting that only the party\u2019s branches could make that demand.\n\nHis loyalists pushed back against the resolution while those aligned to Ramaphosa supported it. The matter became embroiled in legalistic arguments about whether his stepping aside would be just and in keeping with the ANC\u2019s constitution, and that of the country, or not.\n\nBut this misses the point in that it conflates morality and the law. It will scupper the resolution, robbing the ANC of a chance to clean up its act. If the distinction between morality and legality is blurred, the resolution could be mired in misconceptions.\n\nMorality versus the law\n\nMorality shapes people\u2019s lives, including their thoughts and actions, on the basis of what society generally accepts as right and wrong. It is used to check people\u2019s \u201cself-interested, emotional, or sentimental reactions to serious questions of human conduct\u201d. This is what enables people to coexist.\n\nMorality depends on one\u2019s conscience to freely comply with societal expectations.\n\nThe law, which the legal scholar Arthur Scheller Jr defines as \u201can ordination of reason for the common good\u201d, is a system of rules that prescribe behaviour and is enforceable.\n\nVarious formations in society, such as political parties, may have their own laws or rules to regulate the conduct of their members. But such rules should not contradict the supreme law of the land - the constitution - especially in a constitutional democracy founded on the principles of the rule of law.\n\nMorals and laws are not binaries. They complement each other. When the law enhances moral conscience and morality promotes legal consciousness, people can live together harmoniously and ethically.\n\nThe confluence of morality and law is what makes for a good society. This is what the ANC fails to grasp. It uses the law to stymie its own resolution, which is basically about the party reclaiming its political morality.\n\nInstead of those who run foul of the resolution stepping aside, contrasting legal opinions are sought. They don\u2019t provide clarity; they cloud a resolution that has all along been clear.\n\nAs the American sociologist Robert MacIver once said,\n\nto turn all moral obligations into legal obligations would be to destroy morality.\n\nInnocent till proven guilty\n\nSubjecting the ANC\u2019s \u201cstep-aside\u201d resolution to legal interpretation ignores the context that gave rise to it, and its aim of restoring morality within the party. That is imperative if the ANC is to regain trust in society and win votes.\n\nSticking to the legal principle that one is innocent until proven guilty, just to keep those who flout the resolution in office, misses the point.\n\nThe guilt or innocence of a person is a function of a juridical process or law. That they should step aside is a moral stance. It is also for this reason that the party established its integrity commission, whose mandate is to\n\nprotect the image of the organisation and enhance its standing in society by ensuring, among others, that urgent action is taken to deal with public officials, leaders and members of the ANC who face damaging allegations of improper conduct.\n\nThe commission cannot pronounce on the guilt or blamelessness of a person, but on political morality \u2013 a function of moral conscience and consciousness. Unfortunately, it is becoming difficult for some in the ANC to appreciate this. Indeed, as the American political activist Upton Sinclair once said:\n\nit is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe conflation of morality with legality has obfuscated a resolution that led many corruption-weary South Africans to believe that the ANC, which fancies itself \u201cthe leader of society\u201d, was set on a new path of moral political rectitude.\n\nBuilding organisational integrity requires that party leaders be guided by their moral conscience. These should shape the party\u2019s moral disposition in line with its values and principles to achieve its purpose, which has always been about the common good.\n\nChanging the party\u2019s rules to make the integrity commission\u2019s recommendations binding is not going to make party leaders and members internalise morality. What the ANC needs is genuine commitment to institutionalise ethical leadership among all in its ranks."

          "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is the largest and worst relay race in history. Without vaccines or reliable treatment on the horizon, when the curve goes down in one region it goes up in another. Prevention and isolation measures remain the most effective ways to control the curve. But the disease continues to affect not only human health, but all aspects of our lives.\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s international network is working with researchers around the world to report on the latest science, the economy, and the impact of the pandemic in various parts of the world.\n\nThis is our weekly roundup of expert info about the coronavirus.\n\nThe Conversation, a not-for-profit group, works with a wide range of academics across its global network. Together we produce evidence-based analysis and insights. The articles are free to read \u2013 there is no paywall \u2013 and to republish. Keep up to date with the latest research by reading our free newsletter.\n\nThe latest science\n\nIs the medicine already on the market? Professor Nial Wheate of the University of Sydney explains how a low-cost medicine on the market appears to be a possible option for treating COVID-19. Dexamethasone, a common anti-inflammatory, has been successfully used in the treatment of intubated patients. Apparently, this drug reduces pressure in the lungs and improves the respiratory process of seriously ill patients. However, these results are preliminary and we will have to wait for more complete and detailed information.\n\nWhy some scientists are paying close attention to the gut microbiome. At the University of Calgary, researchers Shirin Moossavi and Marie-Claire Arrieta are studying the correlation between the gut microbiome and the severity of COVID-19 infection. They found that the risk is higher in people with high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity, which are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. This evidence opens the possibility of working on certain gut microbiome species that could improve these conditions.\n\nInhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth provides a powerful medical benefit. This is not a meditation course, it is the breathing technique recommended by the University of California, Los Angeles professor and winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine Louis J. Ignarro. This technique takes advantage of the benefits of the nitric oxide (NO) produced in the nasal cavities. The presence of NO in the lungs could help fight coronavirus infections as it dilates the pulmonary arteries and airways, increasing the blood flow and oxygen levels in lungs and blood. Furthermore, when reacting with white blood cells, it generates antimicrobial agents that can destroy bacteria, parasites and viruses.\n\nThe latest gadgets\n\nProtection, MacGyver style. The lack of protection materials and other supplies for the management of the COVID-19 has generated various DIY solutions. Stuart Marshall of Monash University explains why the medical material approval process is long and rigorous.\n\nInfrared thermometers are not necessarily reliable. Professors Andrea Fuller and Duncan Mitchell from the University of the Witwatersrand explain the reasons why fever screening is not effective as a health control measure in public spaces. To detect fever you must measure the internal temperature of the body, but thermal cameras and infrared thermometers measure the temperature on a surface.\n\nThe latest on the economy\n\nThe rise of parasitic capitalism. Richard Shearmur, a professor at McGill University in Montreal explains how, unless employees are duly rewarded for their expenses, teleworking could become a variant of \u201cparasitic capitalism\u201d, whereby corporate profits increasingly rely on extracting value from the public \u2014 and now personal \u2014 realm, rather than on generating new value.\n\nThe disconnected stock market. \u201cThe stock market is not the economy,\u201d wrote economist Peter Krugman. Gunther Capelle-Blancard from the University Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne explains the disconnect between the stock markets and the real world (in French). At the beginning of the pandemic they remained buoyant, when COVID-19 reached Europe they panicked and now they have already recovered their euphoria as if infections, deaths and the confinement of half the world meant nothing to the economy.\n\nThe reshaping of commercial aviation. Professor Pere Suau from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya studies the challenges commercial aviation faces (in Spanish). It is more than likely the crisis will alter the processes of commercial aviation: from the resizing of the supply and demand of travel to airport operations.\n\nThe shift in the tourism industry. Tourism faces the challenge of reinventing itself after the pandemic. For Professor Anna Leask of Edinburgh Napier University, an option for Scotland would be to encourage national tourism.\n\nThe latest in various countries and regions\n\nUS: rural areas more susceptible to COVID-19 than cities. David J. Peters of Iowa State University explains how, at the beginning of the pandemic, rural areas of the US seemed to be better protected from the coronavirus than large cities. This provided a false sense of security which has given way to a spectacular increase in the number of infected people in the least populated areas of the country. The reasons for this phenomenon? An ageing population or the presence of facilities such as military bases, prisons and meat industries as well as the fact that in these small communities the lack of social and welfare services aggravates the situation of vulnerability.\n\nNew Zealand: no longer Coronavirus-free. Despite the good management by New Zealand authorities, after 23 days without positives, two cases were confirmed: two women from the UK who, for compassionate reasons, were allowed to skip quarantine (to visit their dying father). This situation has once again put the country on alert and has forced the suspension of any quarantine exemptions. With this it has become clear that, despite the end of community transmission, control on risk factors must be maintained.\n\nEngland: a group of people were well prepared to do contact tracing when the pandemic broke. Professor Jackie Cassell of Brighton and Sussex Medical School explains how NHS workers who carry out contact tracing in cases of sexually transmitted infections could have helped. In the world of sexually transmitted infections, contact tracing is known as partner notification. The UK\u2019s network of sexual health clinics is unique as a locally embedded public health infrastructure with experience in contact tracing operations.\n\nSpain: entire society is being reshaped. Rafael Puyol, president of the International University of La Rioja, analyses the demographic consequences (in Spanish) of the pandemic in Spain. In 2019, the number of deaths surpassed the number of births by 57,000. In 2020 the difference will be higher due to the deaths caused by the pandemic, and in 2021 due to the decrease in the birth rate. Furthermore, the closing of borders now, and then the economic downturn, will negatively influence the arrival of immigrant workers.\n\nSouth Africa: what to do when confinement and contact tracing don\u2019t work as planned. The country has been unable to maintain confinement long enough to contain the virus, nor to implement testing and contact tracing systems to contain the spread. A group of researchers from the University of the Witwatersrand explain the importance of redirecting efforts towards the management of public spaces, where there is a high risk of contagion. For this, it is essential the authorities provide the population with clear and precise information.\n\nSudan: its transitional government must be supported. As long as there is no vaccine, prevention and care are essential, but particularly difficult in those countries whose institutional weaknesses hinder their governance. Sarah Logan at The International Growth Centre explains how political instability and a limited financial capacity makes Sudan such a fragile state, which should be supported.\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean: greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. The decrease in exports, the fall in the price of raw materials, the collapse of tourism and the drop in the flow of remittances will provoke a great economic crisis (in Spanish). After the pandemic, inequality and poverty will be more pressing. These are the results of the analysis of Professor Ren\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, from the University of Alcal\u00e1.\n\nAnd before you go\n\nScience and faith could walk hand-in-hand. Professors Hakimul Ikhwan and Vissia Ita Yulianto from Gadjah Mada University explain how religious leaders can be of great help to health authorities in convincing many believers of the importance of COVID-19 pandemic prevention.\n\nwww.shutterstock.com\n\nGet the latest news and advice on COVID-19, direct from the experts in your inbox.

          "text": "As lockdown measures start to be eased in most countries around the world, the experts of The Conversation\u2019s global network have focused this week on the major trends that are reshaping trade and the global economy.\n\nJust before the pandemic struck, the economy was already losing momentum. However, the crisis is unlikely to put a stop to globalisation: rather, coronavirus is the starting point for a reconfiguration of the global system. Value chains are shortening in some sectors, China is seeking to extend government control over its economy, and global consumption has been undermined by the recession in the US.\n\nAcademics in our network analyse the impact of the pandemic on globalisation.\n\nThis is our weekly roundup of expert info about the coronavirus.\n\nThe Conversation, a not-for-profit group, works with a wide range of academics across its global network. Together we produce evidence-based analysis and insights. The articles are free to read \u2013 there is no paywall \u2013 and to republish. Keep up to date with the latest research by reading our free newsletter.\n\nReshuffling the deck\n\nChina\u2019s international trade mapped: In order to understand the magnitude of the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic, Jun Du, Agelos Delis, Mustapha Douch and Oleksandr Shepotylo of Aston University mapped China\u2019s recent trade. They showed that worst-affected Chinese imports are machinery and luxury goods. As for exports, goods whose production is labour-intensive, such as furniture, have fallen drastically, as well as capital goods such as nuclear reactors. According to these economists, these trends could be long-lasting, as most countries become aware of the fragility of global value chains \u2013 without, however, completely undermining globalisation.\n\nAuthor provided\n\nTensions between Australia and China: Richard Holden of the Unversity of New South Wales wonders about the new tensions over barley and the impact that the crisis could have on relations between the two countries.\n\nReturn of the local economy: Some countries, faced with the uncertainties of the future, prefer to turn to more local forms of economy. This is the case in Canada, particularly in the area of fisheries. Kristen Lowitt of Brandon University and Charles Z. Levkoe of Lakehead University have looked at policies in north-western Ontario trying to help local people to benefit more from the fish caught in the Thunder Bay area, which are generally destined for export.\n\nGolden days are over: Before the pandemic, the global economy was already showing signs of fragility against the backdrop of trade tensions between China and the US. Countries had been building up their gold reserves, but then just before the COVID-19 pandemic, demand slowed. \u201cIn truth, this was not entirely surprising\u201d, writes Drew Woodhouse (Sheffield Hallam University). \u201cPurchasing bullion at close to a seven-year high, and after a month of prices fluctuating plus or minus about 13%, is no particularly prudent way to consolidate economic and geopolitical power.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s recovery\n\nProtection and control: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang gave a 55-minute speech at China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress on May 22, which had been postponed for two months due to the pandemic, in which he outlined the government\u2019s recovery strategy. He set out a roadmap, deciphered by Jane Duckett, Holly Snape, Hua Wang, Yingru Li (University of Glasgow), with two watchwords: \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d. Li stressed that continued vigilance against the coronavirus will be a core thread determining everything from macro-level strategy down to micro-level policy for the foreseeable future in China.\n\nNg Han Guan/EPA\n\nHard times\n\nOn your own: The economic crisis is hitting the US hard \u2013 tens of millions of Americans are now registering for unemployment as companies close and lay off workers. Despite the federal government\u2019s efforts, people are unable to meet their immediate financial needs for food, care and shelter. As Paul Shafer (Boston University) details, the crisis reveals the major flaws in the American social safety net.\n\nGlobally, the pandemic has also hit developing countries hard.\n\nFood insecurity: Borja Santos Porras (IE University) is concerned about the poverty and food insecurity that the crisis is causing in low-income countries. They believe that these two factors could kill more people than the disease itself.\n\nPandemic poverty: In Indonesia, the poorest are also at the mercy of the virus. Fisca Miswari Aulia (BAPPENAS), Maliki (BAPPENAS) and M Niaz Asadullah (University of Malaya) estimate that an additional 3.6 million people could face poverty as a result of the pandemic.\n\nRefugees struggling: In East Africa, it is the plight of refugees in Nairobi that interests Naohiko Omata (University of Oxford). He points out that these populations have very low incomes, most often generated by daily street sales, and are directly affected by the disease.\n\nGet the latest news and advice on COVID-19, direct from the experts in your inbox.

          "title": "Coronavirus weekly: where are countries finding the money to mitigate economic catastrophe?",
          "text": "The management of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in tough public policy measures around the globe, including lockdowns aimed at reducing human interaction to a minimum. These measures, which have put a stop to big chunks of economic activity, have come with devastating consequences, forcing business to lay off tens of millions of workers globally.\n\nTo mitigate the social and economic impacts, governments have had to dig deep into their finances that in some instances were already under strain. These are over and above the resources that governments need to pump into their health systems as they battle the pandemic. This additional expenditure comes at a time when the shutdown of economic activity has reduced tax collection, placing further strain on the public purse.\n\nThe Conversation has brought together analyses of these issues by its network of experts. In this round up we pulled together some of the articles from the week that was. They cover national budgets in the time of COVID-19, how remote working is worsening inequality, the pandemic\u2019s after-effects on inflation, rising unemployment, and the likelihood of a higher debt burden on future generations.\n\nThis is our weekly round-up of expert information about the coronavirus.\n\nThe Conversation, a not-for-profit group, works with a wide range of academics across its global network. Together we produce evidence-based analysis and insights. The articles are free to read \u2013 there is no paywall \u2013 and to republish. Keep up to date with the latest research by reading our free newsletter .\n\nWhat various countries are doing\n\nGovernments have two options to finance additional expenditures: higher taxes and raising more debt.\n\nIndonesia has decided to issue government bonds to finance a stimulus package to counter the impacts of COVID-19. Nurhastuty K. Wardhani explains that the long-term nature of the bond and its denomination in US dollars will most likely be a burden on future generations.\n\nArgentina is seeking ways to tax its way out of the current economic crisis induced by COVID-19. Alejandro Milc\u00edades Pe\u00f1a and Matt Barlow explain why this is risky for a country that already has very high tax rates.\n\nNew Zealand should unleash aggressive but well-targeted spending, says Ilan Noy. Without it, the burden of an L-shaped economic trajectory will be far greater on future generations than any debt governments might take on now to develop a vaccine or keep businesses afloat and people on payrolls. Norman Gemmell outlines what the country\u2019s forthcoming budget should look like as the country prepares to come out of its COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nA number of African countries face strained public finances, some already struggling to repay their debt. In response, there have been growing calls for debt relief. However, Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal argues that any proposed moratorium must involve lenders and investors to prevent unintended consequences that could be costly for Africa.\n\nCanada is forecasting a twelve-fold increase in its budget deficit this financial year, driven by the sharp drop in forecasted tax collections and the government\u2019s extraordinary spending measures to support the economy and manage the pandemic. However, as Patrck Lebland says, this may not result in higher taxes.\n\n(Bank of Canada)\n\nUS unemployment shot up from 4.4% in March to 14.7% in April, but Jay L. Zagorsky says unemployment is not likely to reach 25%, the highest level reached during the 1933 depression. In his view, the crisis will be short-lived and the US economy will rebound when people resume their economic activities.\n\nAustralia\u2018s Reserve Bank has forecast overly optimistic economic growth and employment (one in 13 people in Australia will lose their jobs) for the next two years, according to Peter Martin. Drawing on what happened after the global financial crisis in 2008, he sees a recovery that looks more like a flat-bottomed boat.\n\nMeanwhile, Alan Shipman cautions about the dangers of a further decline on consumer price inflation. When consumers sense that prices are going to continue falling, they put off expenditure on non-essential purchases, hoping to pick them up later at an even lower price. Such behaviour obviously leads to a decline in consumer spending, one of the major drivers of economic activity.\n\n(Kate Townsend/Unsplash)\n\nWorkplace and inequality\n\nThe office will change beyond the pandemic. Dave Cook outlines the five trends that will shape the workplace of the future.\n\nRemote work can be a source of socioeconomic inequality, warn Ugo Lachapelle and Georges A. Tanguay. While the measure is aimed at slowing down the spread of the pandemic, the researchers analysed 2015 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) data to show that the number of telecommuters increases with personal income. Jobs with a large share of low-income workers generally have few telecommuters and lose out on its benefits.\n\nGet the latest news and advice on COVID-19, direct from the experts in your inbox.

          "text": "This is the week the number of people infected with coronavirus worldwide officially exceeds two million. Since this figure only relates to detected cases, the real number is likely much higher.\n\nThe pandemic is ongoing, and while some countries begin confinement, others hope to ease it soon. At the same time, it is inevitable to think about how the world might change once this is all over, and if a return to \u201cnormality\u201d is even possible.\n\nThis sixth weekly column by our team of international health editors summarises some of the recently published articles from The Conversation\u2019s global network.\n\nThis is our weekly roundup of expert info about the Coronavirus.\n\nThe Conversation, a not-for-profit group, works with a wide range of academics across its global network. Together we produce evidence-based analysis and insights from across academia. The articles are free to read \u2013 there is no paywall \u2013 and to republish.\n\nTreatments, promises and risks\n\nDeveloping treatments and vaccines against a disease takes years, often decades, but right now we do not have the luxury of time. To this end, many researchers are testing the effectiveness of old, already approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Some of the findings so far relate to:\n\nThe effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. This controversial purported treatment for COVID-19, championed by Donald Trump, the US president, has had many doubts cast on its effectiveness. Katherine Seley-Radtke of the University of Maryland summarises the many questions raised by this antimalarial drug.\n\nAntibodies in the blood of survivors. Our immune system is a powerful weapon against infection. Ann Sheehy of the College of the Holy Cross tells us how blood plasma from recovered patients could help fight coronavirus.\n\nThe importance of reducing risks. Social distancing is a fundamental measure to delay the advancement of coronavirus, but its success depends on understanding social interactions must be redefined. Catharine Chambers and Daniel Harris of the University of Toronto explain why we should not make exceptions or let our guard down.\n\nIssues of race and gender\n\nThe pandemic is not affecting everyone equally. The effects of coronavirus differ greatly between different classes, races and genders. Our authors have covered:\n\nHow racism impacts health. Data is now available that indicates African Americans are suffering more severely during the epidemic. Roberta K Timothy of the University of Toronto explains the causes and proposes solutions.\n\nClinical trials not reaching Africa. There are over 150 ongoing clinical trials researching the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Only three are taking place in Africa, and all of them in Egypt. Jenniffer-Mabuka-Maroa, from the African Academy of Sciences, believes the continent has the necessary infrastructures to assist the research.\n\nThe consequences for women. Not only does confinement disproportionally affect the work/life balance of women generally, it raises many issues for women suffering domestic violence. Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Belloso, from the University of Deusto, Spain, defends (in Spanish) the incorporation of a gender perspective in the data and analysis of the pandemic.\n\nPopulism and dictatorship\n\nThe price of populism. Jonatan A Lassa and Miranda Booth, from Charles Darwin University (Australia), discuss the role populist leaders have had in the global failure to respond to COVID-19. Despite this, they fear those same leaders will be able to take advantage of this crisis.\n\nThe Ghanaian law against coronavirus. The government of Ghana has approved an act to combat the pandemic that opens the door to violations of human rights and freedoms. Kwadwo Appiagyei-Atua, from the University of Ghana, discusses the law, its problems and risks.\n\nPast lessons\n\nAdvice from Nelson Mandela. The South African leader spent decades in a tiny cell, where he had to learn to keep his body active. Gavin Evans of Birkbeck, University of London explains how the Nobel Prize winner managed to keep his body and mind healthy thanks to a strict routine.\n\nParallels with the Spanish Civil War. Spain has not experienced a situation similar to the current one since the Civil War of 1936. In a similar fashion to today, volunteering and messages of consolation played an important role in overcoming the tragedy. Dolores Ruiz Berd\u00fan, from the University of Alcal\u00e1 (Spain), explains the commonality between past and present (in Spanish).\n\nLooking to the future\n\nThe Chinese economy needs the rest of the world. The pandemic is a global challenge, and no less for the world\u2019s largest exporter. China struggles to regain lost ground, but it cannot do it alone.

          "text": "The article was updated on Friday November 6, 2020, to reflect the final official figures released by the Electoral Commission.\n\nLabour is celebrating a landslide victory tonight after winning 49% of the vote (confirmed as 50% after special votes were counted). The result means Labour could govern alone \u2014 the first time this has happened since New Zealand introduced a mixed member proportional (MMP) electoral system in 1993.\n\nIn her victory speech, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the result gave Labour \u201cthe mandate to accelerate our [COVID-19] response and our recovery. And tomorrow we start\u201d.\n\nEarlier, National Party leader Judith Collins, whose party only won 26.8% of the vote (reduced to 25.6% in the final count), promised to be a \u201crobust opposition\u201d and \u201chold the government to account for failed promises\u201d.\n\nYou can read the analysis of the results by our five political experts here.\n\nIn the new parliament, Labour will have 65 seats \u2014 four more than the 61 needed to form government. National has 33, the Green Party ten, ACT ten and the M\u0101ori Party is expected to return to parliament with one seat (later increased to two seats after special votes increased the party vote to 1.2%).\n\nThe numbers are a reversal of the 2017 results, when Labour polled 36.9%, National had 44.4% of the vote and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters became the kingmaker.\n\nNew Zealanders had to wait almost a month before Peters announced he would form a coalition with the Labour Party, becoming deputy prime minister. The Green Party joined the coalition in a confidence and supply arrangement.\n\nIn this election, NZ First was ousted from parliament, after the party failed to reach the 5% threshold and neither of its candidates managed to win an electorate seat.\n\nFive parties gained seats in parliament. The M\u0101ori Party is expected to win one of seven M\u0101ori electorate seats and return to parliament even though it only achieved 1% of the party vote (1.2% in the final count). None of the other minor parties won electorate seats or reached the 5% party vote threshold.\n\nCompared to previous elections, record numbers of New Zealanders voted early in 2020. A day before the election, almost 2 million people had already cast their vote.\n\nRead more: NZ election 2020: how might record advance voting numbers influence the final outcome?\n\nMark Coote/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nResults of the referendums\n\nPeople also voted on two referendums: whether the End of Life Choice Act 2019 should come into force and whether the recreational use of cannabis should become legal.\n\nThe results for those are now finalised. Almost two thirds of the vote was in support of the introduction of the Right to Life legislation.\n\nThe vote for legalising the recreational use of cannabis was much closer but the majority favoured the No decision.\n\n2017 election results\n\nIn 2017, the National Party won 44.4% of the votes and on election night, then prime minister Bill English celebrated victory.\n\nBut NZ First won 7.5% and held the balance of power. It was the third time for NZ First leader Winston Peters to become the veto player in the government-formation process.\n\nAfter almost four weeks of negotiations, he opted to go into coalition with Labour, with the Green Party in a confidence and supply role. For the first time under New Zealand\u2019s MMP electoral system, the new government was not led by the party that had won the largest number of seats.\n\nJacinda Ardern became prime minister in an extraordinary period in New Zealand\u2019s political history. Just three months earlier, Ardern had been the deputy leader of a Labour Party polling in minor party territory."

          "text": "Climate Explained is a collaboration between The Conversation, Stuff and the New Zealand Science Media Centre to answer your questions about climate change.\n\nIf you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz\n\nWould it be helpful to undertake a nationwide and coordinated mass planting of trees and plants that are known to have a high uptake of carbon dioxide such as paulownia and hemp alongside the attempts to plant natives?\n\nExotic (but non-invasive) trees have their place in our efforts to capture carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the atmosphere. We could increase plantings of fruit trees and timber that we use to construct our homes. But this question refers to the potentially faster growth of some non-native species, and the associated faster removal of CO\u2082.\n\nImportantly, fast growth (and therefore CO\u2082 uptake) is only one side of the story. The two other points to consider are how big a tree will grow (how much carbon it will ultimately store) and how long it will live. For example, a slower growing tree may end up storing more carbon in the long run.\n\nChina and India are leading the world in regreening the landscape. Many other countries have tree-planting programmes, including New Zealand\u2019s project to plant a billion trees, which argues that the \u201cright tree should be planted at the right time in the right place\u201d.\n\nRead more: Keeping the city cool isn't just about tree cover \u2013 it calls for a commons-based climate response\n\nWhich tree to plant where\n\nIt is pointless to select tree species only for their carbon storage ability, particularly in built-up areas. Here, other selection criteria are much more important: a fast growing tree may need to be cut down after 20 years because it is unsafe, for example. Safety, resilience to environmental pressures in our cities, and aesthetics will come first. A tree that meets these criteria will ultimately be appreciated more, live longer, and store more carbon, regardless of its initial growth rate.\n\nFor rural plantations and afforestation, the rate of growth may well be a consideration. In New Zealand, exotic mono cultures will absorb atmospheric carbon a lot more quickly once planted, and it may be argued that carbon sequestration goals have to be put before biodiversity considerations. Moreover, in the New Zealand context, native trees often take over in exotic (pine) plantations that are left untouched.\n\nAs for the two mentioned plant species: hemp is a herb and thus not competitive with the carbon sequestration ability of trees. But it may be used as an efficient energy crop or in concrete, both with a potentially positive carbon sequestration effect.\n\nPaulownia, while fast growing, has a very low wood density (about half of other trees). Again, it has it\u2019s place as a valuable construction wood, but there is no reason to give preference to this species over native trees in the New Zealand context, at least not from a carbon sequestration perspective.\n\nRead more: Five climate change science misconceptions \u2013 debunked\n\nIn summary, planting a tree is much more important than planting a particular tree. The best solution for selecting a species for a given site will be achieved when we listen to local foresters, the local community, and the latest scientific findings.\n\nWhile planting trees should be promoted in all cases, it must also be understood that this will not save us from cutting carbon emissions if we want to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nThis article is part of The Covering Climate Now series\n\nThis is a concerted effort among news organisations to put the climate crisis at the forefront of our coverage.

          "title": "Charter Argues That P2P Piracy is No Longer a Problem, Labels Disagree * TorrentFreak",
          "text": "ISP Charter Communications believes that P2P piracy is no longer a problem for the music industry, which makes a 'ton of money' from streaming nowadays. Several major record labels clearly disagree with this conclusion, which triggered a new discovery dispute in their ongoing piracy liability lawsuit.\n\nInternet provider Charter Communications is one of several companies being sued for turning a blind eye to pirating subscribers.\n\nThe cases, filed by dozens of major record labels and music companies, allege that Internet providers fail to terminate accounts of repeat infringers.\n\nStakes Are High\n\nThese lawsuits are serious business. In 2019, for example, a jury found Cox liable for the infringements of its customers, awarding a billion dollars in damages to several record labels. This decision was confirmed recently but will be appealed.\n\nWith the stakes this high, the lawsuit against Charter is being fought tooth and nail by both sides. The ISP has already fought back, arguing that the record label\u2019s takedown notices were abusive and misleading. That effort failed and meanwhile, tensions remain high.\n\nWith the trial getting closer the focus has shifted on the core accusations. Over the past two weeks, that resulted in an interesting standoff over P2P piracy including BitTorrent, and whether that is still a problem for the music industry.\n\nP2P is No Longer a Problem\n\nThe origin of this issue dates back to a hearing last year over a discovery request from Charter. The ISP requested revenue details from the music companies, with a specific interest in streaming income in recent years.\n\nAccording to Charter\u2019s attorney Erin Ranahan, this information would be relevant to determine the scale of potential damages, if the ISP is found liable. When P2P piracy is no longer a big issue, the amount could be lower from a deterrence perspective.\n\nWhile making this argument, the attorney stated that P2P piracy is indeed no longer an issue. Not just that, with help from ISPs the music companies now make lots of money from streaming.\n\n\u201cAnd just to give you some background, the snippet of time in which this case involves, because of the total length in the claim period, is a time when this P2P issue was at its most pronounced. Today it\u2019s no longer a problem,\u201d Ranahan said.\n\n\u201cToday plaintiffs\u2019 clients are making a ton of money off of the Internet streaming capabilities [\u2026]. Charter\u2019s Internet is actually giving them a vehicle by which they make a huge amount of money.\u201d\n\nMusic Companies Demand P2P Evidence\n\nThis argument wasn\u2019t well-received by the music companies. While other piracy threats may be more prevalent than P2P piracy, they still see it as a major problem.\n\nTo back this up with data, the companies sent a series of new requests to Charter asking for information. They want to show that P2P piracy is still a problem and that Charter financially benefits from this infringing activity.\n\nAmong other things, Charter was asked to share extensive logs of infringement notices, internal discussions about copyright infringement, as well as monthly revenue statements linked to alleged pirates.\n\nThe music companies argue that they need this information to rebut Charter\u2019s claim that P2P piracy is no longer a problem. The ISP could use this claim as a defense during the trial, they fear.\n\nRequest Denied, For Now\n\nCharter refused to provide the information and pointed out that the court already denied a similar request in the past. During a hearing two weeks ago, the Special Master agreed with the ISP and denied discovery.\n\nThe record labels are not letting the issue go that easily though. This week they were back in court, objecting to the denial. They note that the current request is not related to earlier queries, but is specifically tailored to address the P2P problem comment, which is \u2018new\u2019.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs should be permitted this limited discovery to rebut Charter\u2019s argument that peer-to-peer piracy is no longer a phenomenon to which Charter contributes and which contribution must be deterred,\u201d they argue, hoping to reverse the earlier denial.\n\nThe request was submitted a few days ago and the Colorado federal court has yet to decide whether it will reconsider its position or not.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of the music companies\u2019 objection to the Special Master\u2019s order denying discovery is available here (pdf)"

          "text": "After years of pressure from the authorities and Hollywood, 14 people said to be behind the famous Chinese piracy and subtitling site YYeTs.com have been arrested. At least for now, the site - also known as Renren Yingshi - remains online but for how long isn't yet clear.\n\nBack in 2014, the MPAA made its usual \u2018notorious markets\u2019 submission to the USTR and among regular targets such as The Pirate Bay and Popcorn Time, the Hollywood group highlighted the activities of China-based YYeTs.com.\n\nAt the time, the site \u2013 which is also known as Renren Yingshi \u2013 was described as the most popular dedicated download site for copyrighted content in China, providing links in various formats, including for the popular Xunlei and BitTorrent clients. It rose to fame after being founded in 2004 by a group of Chinese students living in Canada.\n\nNotably, the site was also called out for offering crowd-sourced Chinese subtitles for Western content, something that helped boost infringement of US-made movies and TV shows. On the other hand, it allowed local users to easily consume otherwise unavailable content, to the disappointment of both Hollywood and the Chinese government, albeit for different reasons.\n\nChinese Government Takes Action\n\nOn November 22, 2014, visitors to YYeTs and another subtitle-focused site, Shooters.cn, found the platforms in considerable trouble. With Shooters announcing its immediate closure, YYeTs said that it would be offline for a while, ostensibly to \u201cclean up\u201d its site. State-run news services indicated that the sites had been targeted for infringing the rights of foreign companies.\n\nYYeTs somehow managed to survive, as it had done previously following similar enforcement action in 2010. This week, however, it became clear that the site is under pressure once again after being targeted by local police.\n\nAccording to local media reports, police in Shanghai arrested 14 people under suspicion of being involved in the operations of YYeTs/Renren Yingshi, which was recently reported to have eight million registered users.\n\n\u201cInvestigations showed that the suspects set up several companies engaging in the distribution, operation and maintenance of the \u2018Renren Yingshi\u2019 mobile app and a related web portal by setting up or leasing servers in China or overseas since 2018,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily reported Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that those arrested in this week\u2019s operation systematically downloaded movies and TV shows from pirate websites located outside China, added subtitles, and distributed the captioned videos from their own servers in breach of copyright.\n\nSpecific dates for the arrests haven\u2019t been circulated in the media. But, in mid-January, there were several reports that China-based pirate sites had closed their doors to new members. It\u2019s likely those precautionary measures were linked to the current arrests.\n\nA report from SCMP notes that China has hundreds of subtitling sites similar to Renren Yingshi that originally used volunteer translators. Over time, however, site operators have chosen to hire translators to generate Chinese subtitles for foreign movies and TV shows, paying around $60 per video."

          "text": "The International Olympic Committee is extremely concerned about the impact online piracy could have on the planned Tokyo Olympics. The committee highlights Saudi Arabia as a problem area and it asks the US Government to intervene by placing the Middle Eastern country on its Special 301 Priority Watch List.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) is known to maintain a tight grip on its intellectual property rights.\n\nUsing an image of the Olympic rings or even just the word \u2018Olympic\u2019 can already result in legal trouble, especially when it\u2019s used in a commercial context.\n\nMost valuable, however, are the broadcasting rights. With literally billions of dollars at stake, the IOC and its licensing partners are doing everything in their power to prevent people from streaming their events without permission.\n\nOlympic Piracy Woes\n\nThis stance was made clear once again in a recent submission to the US Trade Representative (USTR). While it\u2019s still uncertain whether the delayed Tokyo summer Olympics will actually take place, the IOC has other worries as well. The organization fears that piracy could spoil the \u201cmagic\u201d of the world\u2019s largest sports event.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely concerned of the impact that online piracy could create during the next 12 months, which will include extensive broadcast coverage of not only the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing,\u201d IOC writes.\n\nWhile piracy is a global phenomenon, the organization appears to be most worried about Saudi Arabia, where beIN Media Group acquired the broadcast rights. Saudi Arabia\u2019s piracy challenges are well-known and even prominent Saudis have been accused of promoting illicit streaming services in the past.\n\nLacking Enforcement in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe most egregious offender was the streaming service beoutQ, which disappeared in 2019. By then, however, many Saudis had become used to cheap streaming options and many unlicensed services remain available today. This is a problem and the IOC calls for stronger enforcement in the region.\n\n\u201cRobust enforcement efforts by Saudi Arabia against piracy are therefore essential to protect the exclusive rights of beIN in the region, support athletes and safeguard the goals of the Olympic movement,\u201d IOC writes.\n\nThe Olympic Committee is worried that if piracy remains rampant the value of their broadcasting rights will decrease. It notes that this threatens the long-term funding of the Olympic movement, part of which indirectly flows back to the sporters.\n\nFrom Torrents to Streaming\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the IOC has voiced its concerns over piracy. Our first reports date back more than a decade ago, when the Committee targeted The Pirate Bay. Over the years, the stakes clearly changed as there are now hundreds if not thousands of high-quality pirate streaming services online.\n\nIOC hopes that the US Trade Representative can help to address this problem. It requests Priority Watch List status for Saudi Arabia in the upcoming Special 301 Report and urges the US to ensure that the Middle Eastern country takes the problem seriously.\n\n\u201cThe IOC respectfully requests that the USTR maintains Saudi Arabia\u2019s position on the Priority Watch List, engages with the Kingdom to protect and enforce the intellectual property rights of rightsholders and considers taking further appropriate steps in order to address the ongoing harm caused to rightsholders and broadcasters from copyright infringements and piracy activities,\u201d it writes.\n\nOlympic Committee is Not Alone\n\nThe IOC is not the only rightsholder to identify Saudi Arabia as a problem area. The country\u2019s piracy issues are also brought up by several other industry groups, sports leagues, and other companies. That includes beIN, which owns the local sports broadcasting rights.\n\nBeIN notes that beoutQ has indeed shut down, but not with help from the Saudi Government, which failed to go after the operators. Also, following beoutQ\u2019s demise, many other pirate services have stepped up to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cThe effects of the beoutQ piracy remain as IPTV applications downloaded onto beoutQ boxes continue to offer thousands of pirated movies, TV shows, and TV channels from the United States, Europe, and across the globe.\n\n\u201cDespite repeated complaints by beIN and other rights holders, Saudi Arabia has never taken criminal or other action against beoutQ, or its Saudi facilitators and supporters,\u201d beIN adds in its letter to the USTR.\n\nThese and other submissions will be used as input for the forthcoming Special 301 Report, which is used by the U.S. as a diplomatic tool to encourage other countries to improve copyright enforcement and legislation.\n\n\u2014\n\nA copy of IOC\u2019s letter to the US Trade Representative is available here (pdf)"

          "text": "Activision and Infinity Ward and have been hit with a copyright infringement lawsuit over Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. According to plaintiff Clayton Haugen, the companies made a direct copy of his character \"Cade Janus\", hiring the same people who helped him create her before renaming and placing \"Mara\" in the game as their own work.\n\nSince 2003, publisher Activision has teamed up with various developers to release Call of Duty games on various platforms. Its longest standing partner is California-based Infinity Ward, whose team was responsible for the 2019 release Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.\n\nAvailable for Windows, PS4 and Xbox One, Modern Warfare received plenty of praise but not everyone is happy with the end result.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in a Texas court yesterday, Activision, Infinity Ward (IW), and Major League Gaming Corp (MLG) committed copyright infringement after copying and then passing off a character design as their own.\n\n\u201cDeliberate, Intentional and Comprehensive Copying\u201d\n\nPlaintiff Clayton Haugen describes himself as a writer, photographer and videographer from North Carolina. He is also the copyright owner of two literary works and 22 photographs of a character he named \u2018Cade Janus\u2019, the central figure in his story \u2018November Renaissance\u2019, which he hoped could be made into a film.\n\nIn 2017, Haugen says he hired \u2018talent\u2019 (actress, cosplayer, twitch streamer Alex Zedra) to portray \u2018Cade Janus\u2019 and took a series of photographs, which together with his story were presented to film studios. In a further promotional effort, the photographs were also published on Instagram and in a series of calendars. It appears that the defendants also became of Haugen\u2019s work.\n\nAs part of their hunt for a \u201cstrong, skilled female fighter\u201d, the defendant videogame companies (through contractors) allegedly hired the same \u2018talent\u2019 (Zedra) and asked her to obtain the same clothing and gear used in the original \u2018Cade Janus\u2019 photoshoot from Haugen himself.\n\nThe companies also hired the same makeup artist, who was instructed to copy the makeup and hair as depicted in the original photographs, \u201ceven using the same hair extension piece.\u201d Haugen further alleges that his original photographs were posted to \u201cthe wall of the studio\u201d and used as a framing guide before the model was 3D-scanned.\n\n\u201cTo conceal their planned infringement of Haugen\u2019s Cade Janus Photographs and his Cade Janus character, Defendants required the talent and the makeup professional to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements,\u201d the complaint notes.\n\n\u201cThe resulting photographs were intended to be, and were, copies of Haugen\u2019s Cade Janus Photographs,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nInfringing Photographs Used to Market Modern Warfare\n\nAccording to Haugen, the resulting photographs and three-dimensional images were not only used to develop the in-game character \u2018Mara\u2019 but also deployed as key assets in Modern Warfare\u2019s marketing campaign.\n\n\u201cWith this infringing female character as the centerpiece of an advertising campaign for the first time in the Call of Duty series, [defendants] shattered all previous sales and games-played records. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has generated more than a billion dollars in revenues,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\n\nCopyright Infringement Claims\n\nAs the copyright owner of the works in question, Haugen explains that he has the exclusive right to make copies and derivatives, and the exclusive right of distribution. The lawsuit reveals that while Haugen had copyrights registered for his story back in 2012 and 2013, the Copyright Office only registered his photographs on December 21, 2020, presumably so he could file this complaint.\n\nHaugen says that the character \u2018Mara\u2019 is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to his creation \u2018Cade Janus\u2019 and provides samples to show that his original photographs were copied during a Modern Warfare photoshoot in 2019.\n\nAs a result, Haugen claims that Activision, Infinity Ward and Major League Gaming have infringed and continue to infringe his rights. In the alternative, Activision Blizzard has or has had a financial interest in the infringement of Haugen\u2019s copyrights so can be held vicariously liable for the infringements of the trio.\n\nIn a further alternative, the defendants knew that the other defendants and their contractors were infringing and induced and/or encouraged that behavior, making them liable for contributory infringement of Haugen\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cHaugen is entitled to recover all monetary remedies from Defendants\u2019 infringement, including all of their profits attributable to their infringements, to the full extent permitted by 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504,\u201d the complaint concludes, demanding a trial by jury.\n\nThe complaint can be found here (pdf)"

[FAIR is] the most consistent guardian we have not only of dissent but of impartiality.\u201d\n\nSusan Faludi\n\n\u201cIt is so important that we have an organization like FAIR: to challenge the crippling social myths that the right promulgates so successfully, to question the \u2018values\u2019 of an infotainment media, to expose the shoddy treatment that women and minorities receive in the press, and to appeal for a diverse and intelligent media that we all deserve and desperately need.\u201d\n\nAbbie Hoffman\n\nExtra! is the best media watch publication in the country; I\u2019d be as confused as everyone else without it.\u201d\n\nJill Nelson\n\n\u201cAs a working journalist, I know that balance, perspective, and a critical eye are simultaneously what are most crucial to honest reportage and, often what are most easily lost in the rush to get a story done\u2026. The work of FAIR has been invaluable in helping me to keep that balance. \u201cThe arrival of Extra! each month is analogous to a collective report card for those in the business of journalism. It tells me which stories hit the mark, which missed, and why.\u201d\n\nStuds Terkel\n\n\u201cIn Extra!, I find all the news that the Respectables find unfit to print. It is great therapy for me; it keeps my blood pressure down and my skull from going numb.\u201d\n\nJudy Muller\n\n\u201cI believe the work of FAIR is, indeed, extremely fair. Not only is the work of this fine organization well-researched and articulated, but it is necessary. I say this as an ABC correspondent (based in Los Angeles for \u2018World News Tonight\u2018 and \u2018Nightline\u2018) whose network is often skewered by this organization. Often (too often!) I agree with their criticism. \u201cFairness & Accuracy in Reporting stands alone in countering the myriad media critics on the far right\u2026. Now and then, their criticisms are on target, as well, but I strongly believe we need a counterbalance. FAIR provides that.\u201d\n\nEdward S. Herman\n\n\u201cFAIR has done an exceptional job in media monitoring and criticism, maintaining a high quality research effort, effectively tapping academic analysts as well as media participants, and avoiding stridency, preaching, and political bias. \u201c[FAIR is] a notable example of the kind of critical and constructive media organization that serves an essential democratic function, that we need to encourage and supplement if we are to democratize the media and make it more a servant of the larger public interest.\u201d\n\nJoel Rogers",

          "text": "Italy announced last July 1 the seizure of 84 million counterfeit pills of the amphetamine Captagon, widely used by combatants in the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. The pills, seized in the southern Italian port of Salerno and said to be worth 1 billion euros, were immediately attributed to ISIS, one of the primary parties to the Syrian conflict.\n\nBut the narrative quickly did an about-face, and blame was reassigned to ISIS\u2019s mortal enemies: the Syrian government and\u2014perhaps more importantly\u2014Hezbollah, the Syrian government-allied Lebanese political party and militant organization that has long been a thorn in the side of the US empire and its integral Israeli appendage.\n\nOn August 4, coincidentally the same day that the Beirut port explosion devastated Lebanon\u2019s capital city, the Washington Post ran a dispatch by Joby Warrick and Souad Mekhennet, headlined \u201cHezbollah Operatives Seen Behind Spike in Drug Trafficking, Analysts Say.\u201d While the authors concede that \u201cwhether Hezbollah was directly involved in the Italian shipment is not yet known,\u201d the ultimate takeaway is that \u201cinvestigators say the episode fits a pattern of recent drug cases in the Middle East and Europe linked to the powerful Lebanese militia.\u201d The idea that \u201cHezbollah operatives began manufacturing [Captagon] more than a decade ago\u201d is presented as fact without need for evidence.\n\nAs is par for the course for such articles, the \u201canalysts\u201d are largely unnamed, consisting of the usual assortment of anonymous \u201cintelligence officials\u201d and the like. Among the few named officials are John Fern\u00e1ndez, head of the US Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s Counter-Narcoterrorism Operations Center\u2014whose briefing on Hezbollah at the fervently pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) is quoted\u2014and Matthew Levitt, a former Treasury official and FBI analyst now ensconced at WINEP, where he is perennially available to link Hezbollah to any and every narco-terrorist plot on the planet.\n\nIn their piece, Warrick and Mekhennet plug Levitt\u2019s latest pride and joy, an interactive map that purports to implicate Hezbollah operatives in \u201cdrug smuggling, money laundering and other criminal enterprises in dozens of countries around the world, while also charting terrorist attacks financed by such illicit proceeds.\u201d A quick perusal reveals that key global enterprises have unfortunately been overlooked, such as the \u201cHezbollah pig farm in Liberia\u201d that was dutifully exposed in 2018 by US State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Nathan A. Sales. Other essential components of the fearmongering arsenal do, however, appear in Levitt\u2019s database, including Hezbollah\u2019s alleged narco-ties to Venezuela\u2014a country that must be demonized at all cost on account of its refusal to subscribe to US-prescribed systems of right-wing oppression\u2014as well to as the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), myriad drug cartels and other preferred imperial bogeymen.\n\nIn his book Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon\u2019s Party of God, Levitt retails all of the traditional neoconservative talking points about said party, such as Hezbollah assisting the cartels in constructing narco-tunnels from Mexico into the US\u2014because, obviously, \u201cthe terrain along the southern US border, especially around San Diego, is similar to that on the Lebanese/Israeli border.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the old rumor of a \u201crise in imprisoned gang members with Farsi tattoos\u201d in the American Southwest\u2014which, as Fox News noted in 2010, had also elicited a letter to the Homeland Security Department from then-US Rep. Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), who fretted:\n\nWe have typically seen tattoos in Arabic, but Farsi implies a Persian influence that can likely be traced back to Iran and its proxy army, Hezbollah.\u2026 These tattoos in Farsi are almost always seen in combination with gang or drug cartel tattoos. These combinations have been increasing in number and point to the fact that these criminals are tied to both Hezbollah and gangs and drug cartels.\n\nAnd there you go. Though the beloved \u201cCommunist menace\u201d of the Cold War is making a comeback in both Russian and Chinese forms, it\u2019s still helpful to have a narco-jihadi menace\u2014in bed with socialist regimes in Latin America, no less\u2014festering along the United States\u2019 southern border. This justifies increased US militarization of the hemisphere, global antagonism vis-\u00e0-vis Hezbollah\u2019s backers in America\u2019s current pet enemy Iran, and all sorts of other good stuff.\n\nLevitt\u2019s book also covers other popular anti-Hezbollah would-be trivia, such as that it was possible (at least in pre-pandemic times) to travel with minimal difficulty between Caracas and Tehran by air\u2014a trajectory known as \u201cAero-Terror\u201d by the likes of Roger Noriega, former US assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere affairs and current permanent accessory at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute. Noriega in 2011 sounded the alarm at Fox News that the Venezuelan state airline was ferrying \u201cterrorists and weapons to our own neighborhood,\u201d with merely a single stop in Damascus. Never mind that it is also possible to travel between Caracas and pretty much everywhere else on earth.\n\nAccording to a 2011 Foreign Policy Research Institute missive titled \u201cThe New Nexus of Narcoterrorism: Hezbollah and Venezuela,\u201d by Caracas-born socialite-cum-\u201cterrorism expert\u201d Vanessa Neumann, Aero-Terror appears to have departed Venezuela with a \u201ccargo of cocaine\u201d and returned \u201cfull of Iranians, who boarded the flight in Damascus, where they arrived by bus from Tehran.\u201d Neumann never deigned to explain why the Iranians could not have simply boarded the flight in the Iranian capital rather than riding on a bus for more than 1,000 miles.\n\nAs if Farsi tattoos weren\u2019t enough, Levitt unveils in his book additional alleged nefarious activities by Hezbollah in the US proper, including \u201cfood stamp fraud, misuse of grocery coupons and sale of unlicensed T-shirts.\u201d One envisions Hezbollah guerillas diabolically stockpiling buy-one-get-one-free Cocoa Puffs to sell on the international black market, along with fake Hypercolor apparel featuring Kalashnikovs. Levitt is consistently cited as an authoritative source in corporate media reports on Hezbollah and related themes, and relied upon in US government circles as the expert of experts.\n\nAs for the July seizure in Italy of the billion-euro amphetamine shipment, it wasn\u2019t only the Washington Post that jumped on the Hezbollah/Captagon bandwagon with no evidence. In an August Foreign Policy article headlined \u201cThe Islamic State Isn\u2019t Behind Syria\u2019s Amphetamine Trade,\u201d Tessa Fox insists that \u201cCaptagon production flourished in Syria after 2013, when a crackdown in neighboring Lebanon likely forced Hezbollah to relocate its drug production operations next door,\u201d and that Syrian \u201cdrug operations would likely not be possible without the technical knowledge of Hezbollah, which has links to Captagon production in [the Syrian cities of] Homs, Tal Kalakh and Qusayr, near the Lebanese border.\u201d A December video courtesy of BBC Mideast correspondent Quentin Sommerville confirms that the \u201cSyrian regime\u201d and Hezbollah are both \u201cdeep in the drugs trade,\u201d which is for them a \u201cmajor source of funding.\u201d\n\nAccusing Hezbollah of drug trafficking is kind of like accusing the US government of trafficking in glow-in-the-dark Joseph Stalin figurines; it makes no ideological sense on any level. If the organization were really up to its ears in drugs, there presumably would not be a need to resort to such patently ludicrous arguments as that \u201cVenezuela\u2019s geographic proximity to West Africa make[s] it an ideal launching pad\u201d for trans-Atlantic narco-shipments that help expand Hezbollah\u2019s coffers. This insight was delivered during a 2009 presentation to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations by former United Press International bureau chief in El Salvador Douglas Farah, who refrained from explaining how 6,000 miles constitutes \u201cgeographic proximity.\u201d\n\nLebanese scholar Amal Saad, author of Hizbu\u2019llah: Politics and Religion, commented in a recent email to me that the \u201cbaseless charges\u201d against Hezbollah \u201cdon\u2019t merely clash with its ideology and identity as an Islamist party whose adherents are socialized in the Islamic way of life, which obviously has zero tolerance for drug use,\u201d but that they also \u201cundermine Hezbollah\u2019s strategy of combating drug use\u201d in various areas in Lebanon, where other Shia clans are known to distribute drugs. She went on to remark that drug trafficking and use are \u201canathema to Hezbollah for organizational reasons\u201d and that there is \u201cno room for drugs for a party with strong internal discipline,\u201d for which drug trafficking would \u201cseverely undermine its internal cohesion, popular support, and organizational and military efficacy vis-\u00e0-vis Israel and jihadi groups.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to Israel, which, it bears mentioning, is entirely responsible for Hezbollah\u2019s existence in the first place. In 1982, the Israeli military invaded Lebanon, in the middle of that country\u2019s civil war of 1975\u201390, slaughtering some 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians\u2014as Noam Chomsky emphasizes, the vast majority of them civilians\u2014and prompting the rise of the militant organization. Hezbollah then undertook to combat the brutal, torture-happy 22-year Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, ultimately driving Israel out of Lebanese territory in May 2000.\n\nFrom a \u201cterroristic\u201d point of view, Hezbollah has never even come close to inflicting the human and infrastructural damage that Israel has. During the 1982 invasion, for example, the Israeli army engaged in phosphorus shelling of Muslim-majority West Beirut, which caused patients to start arriving at hospitals literally on fire. In his book Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War, journalist Robert Fisk quoted a doctor on the situation of five-day-old twins who were dead upon arrival: \u201cI had to take the babies and put them in buckets of water to put out the flames. When I took them out half an hour later, they were still burning.\u201d\n\nThe list goes on. In April 1996, Israel massacred 106 refugees sheltering at a United Nations compound in the south Lebanese village of Qana. In summer 2006, Israel killed some 1,200 people in Lebanon over the course of 34 days, including children in the back of a pickup truck evacuating their village in accordance with Israeli orders, only to be slaughtered at close range by an Israeli helicopter.\n\nFor this particular conflict, the United States conducted rush shipments of weapons to the Israeli armed forces. Not that the US has ever been a stranger to abetting carnage in the diminutive Levantine nation; a certain civil war episode from 1985 comes to mind, when CIA-trained operatives endeavored to assassinate Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah\u2014the Lebanese cleric forever vilified as Hezbollah\u2019s supposed \u201cspiritual leader\u201d\u2014via car bomb in Beirut, and instead dispensed with more than 80 civilian lives, among them many women and children. But, again, Hezbollah are the \u201cterrorists\u201d\u2014if only because they happen to effectively thwart imperial designs in the region.\n\nThe hypocritical logic of empire furthermore permits the US to sensationally denounce Hezbollah as narco-terrorists while blissfully backing regimes that objectively qualify as such. For instance, one of the highlights of Levitt\u2019s interactive map is Operation Titan, a two-year collaboration between the DEA and Colombian authorities to investigate the \u201cColombia-based cocaine smuggling and money laundering operations\u201d of an alleged Hezbollah operative.\n\nTitan was launched in 2004, on the watch of then\u2013Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, who not only appeared on a 1991 US Defense Intelligence Agency list of \u201cthe more important Colombian narco-traffickers contracted by the Colombian narcotic cartels,\u201d but also presided over the terrorization of swathes of the Colombian population, like the more than 10,000 civilians murdered by the military and passed off as FARC guerrillas. The so-called \u201cfalse positives\u201d campaign enabled individual soldiers to accrue bonus pay and extra holiday time, while also justifying\u2014what else?\u2014yet more US military aid.\n\nThere\u2019s also Honduras, where US-backed President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is, you know, a drug lord, and has also overseen countless extrajudicial killings and other forms of human rights obliteration.\n\nWere the US actually opposed to narco-terrorism, it might have abstained from utilizing right-wing Contra mercenaries to terrorize Nicaragua in the 1980s while simultaneously enabling those same Contras to enrich themselves via the drug trade\u2014an arrangement that resulted in a crack cocaine epidemic that destroyed Black communities in South Central Los Angeles. So much for protecting Americans from foreign terrorists.\n\nAmerica\u2019s narco-terror hype begins to make more sense when one considers Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Ginger Thompson\u2019s 2015 New Yorker article \u201cTrafficking in Terror,\u201d in which a former senior money-laundering investigator at the US Justice Department tells her that, following the 9/11 attacks and the funneling of resources into \u201cterrorism\u201d rather than drug enforcement, the concept of narco-terror \u201cbecame an \u2018expedient way for the [DEA] to justify its existence.\u2019\u201d\n\nThompson writes that after the crime of \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d was appended to the new iteration of the Patriot Act in 2006, the DEA was able to claim \u201cvictories against Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and the FARC.\u201d Disturbingly, however, in every last one of the cases that were prosecuted, the \u201conly links between drug trafficking and terrorism entered into evidence were provided by the DEA, using agents or informants who were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lure the targets into staged narco-terrorism conspiracies.\u201d\n\nNow, as the Captagon conspiracies take off and the US and allied media continue trafficking in propaganda\u2014poisoning the public mind with narco-terror fantasies that justify all manner of belligerence and terror for the foreseeable future\u2014that old image of frying eggs from US drug war TV adverts comes to mind: \u201cThis is your brain on drugs.\u201d",

          "title": "Covering School Reopening, Chicago Papers Pit Unions Against Parents",
          "text": "As FAIR (12/9/20) has reported, the New York Times has pushed for reopening public schools over teachers union concerns in New York City.\n\nNow in Chicago, the city\u2019s two major papers\u2014the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times\u2014are editorially aligning against the teachers union, whose members recently voted to keep working remotely, framing a thorny public health problem requiring participation and transparency as a dispute between bad-actor unions and educators, parents and children.\n\nAs the Chicago Sun-Times (1/24/21) reported, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) members voted not to work in person \u201cbecause of health and safety concerns,\u201d which the city said would be a strike action, though they subsequently agreed to \u201cdelay the scheduled return of thousands of teachers and staff,\u201d leaving the outcome in limbo.\n\nHow much children can spread Covid-19 through in-person school is still a matter of some dispute (AP, 9/22/20; US News & World Report, 12/2/20). The Wall Street Journal (1/16/21) reported that \u201ca consensus is emerging in Europe that children are a considerable factor in the spread of Covid-19\u2014and more countries are shutting schools for the first time since the spring.\u201d The Independent (11/7/20) reported on a Lancet study that found that \u201creopening schools following coronavirus lockdowns is linked to a surge in transmissions within a month.\u201d\n\nBut most to the point, JAMA (1/26/21) noted that while school reopening is possible, it can only be attained when safety standards are met; it noted that despite some evidence that schools aren\u2019t superspreader sites, \u201cstaff and students should continue to have options for online education,\u201d because \u201csome school-related activities have increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among students and staff.\u201d\n\nYet a drumbeat in the press claims that it isn\u2019t health and safety concerns appropriate to a deadly pandemic keeping schools closed, but meddlesome labor unions. USA Today (1/26/21) insinuated such in a prominently featured story, which after confidently asserting that \u201cstudies have shown in-school transmission of the virus is low\u201d and that \u201cthousands of schools have successfully brought kids back in person,\u201d lamented:\n\nYet many parents are realizing their children may never see their teachers in person this year. A growing number blame their local teachers union.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times (1/21/21) urged against a strike on grounds that it would disrupt the education of preschoolers and special needs students who are already back to school, and disrupt the lives of working parents. The paper also said that the union should accept the incremental reopening plan because teachers are being fast-tracked for immunization.\n\nTo bolster their position, Sun-Times editors cited an op-ed in their paper (12/29/20) signed by more than a dozen doctors in support of school reopening. The op-ed concentrates on the risk of children as vectors, underplaying that adults, too, work in schools\u2014and often take public transit to get there. Teachers in the US are testing positive for Covid-19 at a higher rate than the general population, though that could be because teachers are tested more often (Chalkbeat, 1/12/21). In addition, new variants have introduced the possibility of increased risks in schools, as elsewhere (Science, 1/15/21).\n\nThe CTU points out (1/26/21) that teachers are \u201cseeking a health metric based on CDC guidance, a phased reopening, access to vaccinations for educators, and enforceable safety standards in school buildings,\u201d and that right now, schools are well short of those goals. Specifically, the union said that schools don\u2019t have \u201caccess to adequate testing and tracing programs, proper PPE, necessary room ventilation and sanitization, and priority vaccination of educators and school support staff.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s position isn\u2019t that schools can never open, but that safety standards should be met. Chicago school nurses also sided with teachers, arguing that the CPS reopening plan was unfeasible (WGN, 1/14/21), and an arbitrator ruled schools were unsafe for some workers last fall (Chicago Sun-Times, 10/2/20).\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times board (1/12/21) had urged the union and the city to engage in reopening, despite outstanding concerns. The framing the board used, however, was deceptive. \u201cNow more than ever,\u201d the board wrote, \u201cCPS and CTU must come together to make this reopening safe and successful,\u201d adding that \u201cthe two sides have just got to be professionals, do their jobs and get over it.\u201d This sounds like a middle-ground position, but it\u2019s the city who wants to reopen quickly, and it\u2019s the union that wants to stop reopening if it isn\u2019t safe.\n\nThe very next part of that sentence cites a Sun-Times op-ed (1/11/21) from the leader of Educators 4 Excellence, which had the same framing. As FAIR (12/9/20) has previously reported, the group is a big-money backed, anti\u2013teachers union organization. This framing has the aura of \u201ccompromising adult in the room,\u201d when it is actually anti-union bullying. The CTU is, in fact, on record calling for a mediator to help settle the dispute (WGN, 1/26/21).\n\nThe Chicago Tribune editorial board (1/25/21) not only weighed in on this most recent work action, saying that the union is cloaking an \u201cillegal\u201d strike with trumped-up concern about safety, which will hurt minority students acutely. But this fits a general anti-CTU pattern, as the board had blasted (1/14/21) an attempt to loosen state legal regulations on the ability of teachers to strike; the legislation wouldn\u2019t have an impact on the current reopening drama, but it was meant to give \u201cChicago teachers the same rights that teachers already have in every other school district statewide\u201d (WTTW, 1/11/21). The paper also ran an op-ed (1/21/21) calling any strike move in response to pandemic reopening \u201cillegal,\u201d a clear echo of the city\u2019s position (Chicago Sun-Times, 1/21/21). The opinion piece was written by an attorney from the legal outfit that argued the Supreme Court case Janus v. AFSCME, which imposed an anti-union \u201cright-to-work\u201d regime on all public-sector unions, like CTU, so the anti-CTU motivation is clear here.\n\nLast month the Tribune board (12/14/20) rebuked a now-deleted CTU tweet calling reopening plans sexist and racist, using redbaiting (denouncing a CTU delegation to Venezuela\u2014Chicago Tribune, 8/19/19) and pro-police rhetoric (the union has supported the call to \u201cdefund the police\u201d in the wake of several brutal police killings of unarmed Black people in 2020) as dubious reasons to suggest the union was going too far to protect its members in a pandemic.\n\nThe editorial line echoes the paper\u2019s coverage, which, despite CTU\u2019s long history (In These Times, 10/29/19) of tying its demands to the needs of parents and teachers, portrayed a fight (lots of language about children being \u201cleft behind\u201d) between teachers who didn\u2019t want to go to work and students who need to get back to school (Chicago Tribune, 1/22/21). That framing is off balance, as NPR affiliate WBEZ (1/22/21) reported that \u201cattendance figures [show] few students are actually choosing in-person learning,\u201d and that \u201cabout 19% of students eligible to return for in-person classes walked into school buildings last week.\u201d\n\nThe CTU is attracting anti-union outrage from media far from home as well. The Wall Street Journal editorial board (1/25/21), with its trademark hyperbole, said the union \u201cis taking kids hostage to extract more money from Congress with no guarantee that it will release them if it does.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s telling that the Lightfoot administration, a Democratic government in a Democratic stronghold like Chicago, must rely on right-wing, anti-union talking points from the city\u2019s two newspapers to bolster its campaign against the teachers\u2019 union. \u201cBoth the mayor and the two editorial boards represent the views of the wealthy and mostly white people in our city,\u201d Rossana Rodriguez, a Chicago alderman (a city council member, in Chicago-speak) who was elected with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, told FAIR. She went on:\n\nThe fact that only 19% of students [who are] back in schools showed up, and that they have refused to release the demographic data for these students, is highly concerning. The mayor has been talking about equality in the context of reopening schools the whole time. The statistics tell us that an overwhelming majority of the Black and brown families chose to keep their children remote. We know that the reopening plan is not about equality. Companies need employees back, and closed schools make that hard.\n\nAnd the slant falls into the usual corporate media trap of framing these disputes as teachers putting their needs above those of students and families. Teachers are concerned about safety in the schools generally, not just for them, but for everyone who comes into contact with anyone who comes in and out of a school. There\u2019s also a dehumanization of teachers when labor conflicts are framed as thought teachers\u2019 concerns are antithetical to parents\u2019 concerns. Many teachers are also parents. Many parents know or are friends with (or related to) a teacher. This framing serves to make unions into sterile political bodies, not a group of people with human concerns.\n\nParents, teachers, students and administrators would all likely agree that remote learning has been a headache (and heartache) for all involved. We\u2019d all love to get back to so-called \u201cnormal.\u201d The question is how to do this safely. The strike vote in Chicago represents working-class fear of the city\u2019s plans. The editorial boards aren\u2019t just taking an anti-strike stance, they\u2019re telling workers to swallow their fears and do as they are told. This isn\u2019t democratic governance.\n\nThis is not just a local squabble. Other than the fact that Chicago is one of America\u2019s biggest cities, the CTU is a militant union that has set a standard for more social justice\u2013oriented teacher unionists around the country who want to use the strike weapon, not for teacher pay and benefits, but to demand more investment in education and more resources for students (Jacobin, 10/13/20). Anti-union forces around the country depend on Chicago\u2019s editorial boards to blunt the force of the CTU, lest it inspire more teachers around the country.",

          "text": "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is excited to work with the National Library of Medicine on NIH MedlinePlus magazine to highlight important research on physical activity and heart health.\n\nThe magazine's cover star is DeMarcus Ware, a former National Football League player who has translated his passion for fitness off the field. In addition to lifting weights and working out in the gym, Ware gets moving with his two kids and has cut a rug in \"Dancing with the Stars,\" blending fitness with family time and fun. In this most recent issue, we share new research funded by NHLBI on how physical activity can do more than get you in shape.\n\nCombined with a healthy diet, physical activity may help prevent future heart issues by improving your cholesterol and blood pressure and lowering your risk of type 2 diabetes. As we celebrate American Heart Month this February, it's important to recognize how you don't have to be an athlete to get moving and help your heart. Just 30 minutes of activity each day can go a long way to preventing heart-related diseases in the future.\n\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans can provide more specific guidance for older Americans, kids, and teens. During American Heart Month, use #OurHearts on social media to show your community how committed you are to staying heart healthy. We wish you a happy and healthy start to 2021!\n\n\n\n\n\nGary H.

She joined gyms and exercised on occasion, but never found a routine she could maintain.\n\n\"I felt intimidated because I didn't know how to use a machine at the gym, and awkward because I was the overweight girl trying to work out,\" she says. \"I assumed that I couldn't be an athlete or physically fit. I had accepted that was the way I was meant to be.\"\n\n\"The community is what has kept me coming back. The friends I've made keep me motivated.\" \u2013 Sara Santiago\n\nIn February 2019, Sara was working 60 hours a week and had started drinking. Her depression grew worse and her weight climbed to 230 pounds. With support from her doctors and her manager, she took a leave of absence from her job to focus on her health.\n\n\"My brother called me and said I needed to find a gym with a strong community,\" she says. \"I had moved from Massachusetts to California, and he knew that was tough on me. I found a studio with fitness classes and knew I would probably hate them, but I tried them anyway.\"\n\nClear signs of progress\n\nSara took her first class, which combined high-intensity cardio with weightlifting, and was hooked. With help from trainers, she started gradually, walking 3 miles per hour and using 5-pound weights.\n\nToday, she runs a mile in under 10 minutes and lifts 20-pound weights.\n\n\"My brother told me to show up 15 minutes early and stay 15 minutes late to talk to people and make friends,\" she says. \"And he was right\u2014the community is what kept me coming back. The friends I've made keep me motivated.\"\n\nA new perspective\n\nSince beginning her fitness journey, Sara has lost 70 pounds and gained a new perspective.\n\n\"When there's a drought in California, the grass turns brown. But once it rains a few times, it comes back green,\" she says. \"That was my body. It wanted to be healthy, but it needed me to take care of it, both mentally and physically. Today I'm strong, I'm fit, I'm happy, I'm sober, and I'm healthy.\""

Now, the former Dallas Cowboy and Denver Bronco All-Pro has a new starring role: helping others improve their fitness and health. He spoke about what keeps him motivated, his favorite healthy snack, and how he and his family lead healthy lives.\n\nYou have said that you are in better shape now in retirement than when you were playing in the NFL. Why is that?\n\nRetiring from the NFL has allowed me to have a healthier lifestyle. I get more rest and recovery time between workouts and my body doesn't get beaten up and bruised every week. I've also cut in half the number of calories I take in. Some people say that your life stops when you retire. For me, it has started!\n\n\"Some people say that your life stops when you retire. For me, it has started!\" \u2013 DeMarcus Ware\n\nTell us about your diet.\n\nI eat three healthy meals a day and a few healthy snacks. For example, I usually eat oatmeal with blueberries before my 45-minute morning workout. After that I have a full breakfast with things like brown rice, eggs, chicken sausage, and a protein shake. For lunch I'll have fish, broccoli, and whole-grain rice. And for dinner I'll have a lean meat, vegetables, and sweet potato. Also, one day every week I treat myself to food I can't have the other days. If I'm tempted to eat something I shouldn't, it helps to be able to tell myself I can have it, just not that day.\n\nWhen did you start your healthy habits?\n\nAs a kid, I played four sports and always made a priority of staying fit. I looked into the diets of the sports stars I wanted to be like. So, I started eating healthier then. I couldn't afford much of the fresh foods that these stars were eating, but I got the frozen versions, which were still healthy.\n\nHow are you instilling healthy diet and fitness habits in your kids?\n\nGiving your kids a positive experience with healthy foods is important. If I were to tell my kids I don't like how sweet potatoes taste, they won't like sweet potatoes. But if instead I put a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon on them and say it tastes like sweet potato pie, they'll love it. Regarding fitness, my son and daughter didn't enjoy exercise at first. But now they love to go out and do any kind of exercise because we do it together and we make it fun. It is a staple of our family routine.\n\nWhat motivates you to get moving when you don't feel like it?\n\nWe all need help with motivation from time to time. I like to use both sound and visual imagery. I'll make myself a playlist of upbeat music or listen to motivational speeches. I also like to look at pictures of healthy role models who inspire me about what I'd like to achieve with my workouts. That helps me create a mental image of what I'd like to look like, like having a toned, fit body.\n\nWhat other healthy habits do you try to keep up?\n\nI do stretches and I use a foam roller to relieve tension in my muscles in the morning and night before I go to sleep. I am also sleeping and resting more now. I used to go to bed at midnight and wake up at 6 a.m. Now I go to sleep at 10:30 p.m. I feel more fit as a result.\n\nYou were on the 27th season of \"Dancing with the Stars.\" How did your fitness play into that?\n\nCompeting on \"Dancing with the Stars\" (DWTS) was one of the most challenging things I've ever done. In football I played defensive line, and I was known as a body mover. To do my job, I had to move guys who were 6 feet 5 inches tall and 365 pounds. For \"DWTS\" I had to have sweet feet, twinkle toes! I had to train myself very differently, with a real focus on mental quickness. I'm still doing some dancing now as part of my fitness routine because it requires you to think while you are moving.\n\nWhat does the future look like for DeMarcus Ware?\n\nMy ultimate goal is to help motivate people to improve their fitness. Recently, I opened a gym in Texas, where I live. I'm also launching a new digital fitness app. I was a computer science major in college, so I enjoyed applying that knowledge to my expertise in fitness."

He is now serving his sentence \u2013 alongside participants of recent protests \u2013 at a immigration detention facility outside of Moscow.\n\nSo far, more than 30 Russian media outlets have expressed their solidarity and support for Smirnov and the Mediazona project, demanding that he be freed.

          "text": "Religious pogroms are horrifyingly common in India. There was a minor pogrom against Muslims in Delhi in January last year, a major one in Gujarat in 2002, and more in Mumbai in 1992. Christians have faced a rise in violence since 1998. And for Sikhs like me, the year 1984 \u2013 the year of what we call the Sikh Genocide \u2013 is firmly etched into our collective memory.\n\nThat year, India\u2019s then-prime minister Indira Gandhi launched a military assault on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism\u2019s holiest shrine, which was occupied by groups demanding greater autonomy. After Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation, thousands of Sikhs across the country were murdered in religious pogroms, with the connivance of Gandhi\u2019s governing Indian National Congress party.\n\nMany Sikhs now worry that a second massacre is on the way. They have good reason. \u201cRepeat 1984\u201d has become the rallying cry of some Hindu nationalist social media users who support Modi\u2019s government.\n\nSome activists, driven by the \u2018Hindutva\u2019 Hindu nationalist ideology that underpins Modi\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have already started holding menacing rallies outside Sikh places of worship. They had implicit sanction from the top when Modi claimed, falsely, that the Indian flag had been \u201cinsulted\u201d by the protesters who stormed the Red Fort. (It wasn\u2019t. Farmers didn\u2019t touch the Indian flag.)\n\nA country where Hindus come first\n\nThe BJP and its allies are using a classic divide-and-rule tactic, which they have copied from British colonialists. But it is part of a broader strategy to turn India into a Hindu theocracy.\n\nThe government sees India as a country for Hindus, first and foremost. All others are second-class citizens who must continually prove their loyalty. Hindu nationalists like to say that Sikhs are part of \u201cthe Hindu umbrella\u201d and therefore an integral part of India \u2013 unlike Muslims and Christians \u2013 but recent events have exposed the hollowness of their claim.\n\nIndia is a multi-faith country being transformed into a country where Hindus are top-tier citizens and everyone else is below them on the pecking order. Anyone who disagrees is painted as \u2018anti-national\u2019. Last year, when Indian Muslims protested peacefully against a law that aimed to exclude many Muslims from citizenship, they were accused of being potential terrorists working for Pakistan. During the pogrom in Delhi in January 2020, erroneously framed as a \u201criot\u201d by many media outlets, police either stood by or took part."

          "text": "After nearly a year of living with COVID-19, the public health aspects of the disease are now well understood. But the economic impact of the crisis continues to mystify.\n\nOn the one hand, the pandemic has triggered the most severe recession in living memory: national income has collapsed, unemployment is rising, and many households and businesses are struggling to survive.\n\nBut on the other hand, stock markets are booming, house prices are soaring, and the rich appear to be getting even richer. How can this be reconciled?\n\nThe frenzy surrounding the troubled US video game retailer, GameStop, provides a useful case study. After years of struggling to keep pace with online competition, many analysts expected that COVID-19 would be the final nail in the coffin for the high-street retailer. Sensing a vulnerable victim, hedge funds swooped in and placed big bets that the share price of GameStop would decline (known in the industry as \u2018short selling\u2019).\n\nIn another universe, the story would have ended here: GameStop would have continued to decline, hedge funds would have cashed-in, and barely anyone would have noticed.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t quite turn out that way. Instead, the share price soared from $20 on 11 January to a high of $483 last week, representing one of the greatest stock market rallies of modern times. The official narrative is that an army of amateur investors organised on the online forum Reddit to purchase GameStop shares and drive the price up. In doing so, they managed to inflict significant financial pain on the hedge funds who had bet against the company, while making a tidy profit themselves.\n\nCommentators were quick to hail the GameStop story as a triumph of ordinary citizen investors over major Wall Street speculators. Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, described the event as a \u201cbottom-up revolution\u201d that has irreversibly shifted power to small investors.\n\nWhile this \u2018David vs Goliath\u2019 narrative undoubtedly captured the world\u2019s imagination, the reality is less romantic. It is now widely believed that well-resourced professional traders played a major role bidding up the share price by posing as ordinary members of the public on Reddit. Some have gone further and suggested that much of the share price volatility has been driven by \u201cinternecine hedge fund warfare\u201d \u2013 hedge funds covertly placing large bets against each other using the Reddit media frenzy as a convenient smokescreen.\n\nEither way, the fact that GameStop\u2019s biggest shareholders are some of the world\u2019s largest investment firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity should pour cold water over the idea that this was a battle between big finance and small plucky investors. It was these Wall Street behemoths \u2013 not Reddit users \u2013 who stood to gain the most from the boom."

          "text": "In June 2020, an American soldier was charged with sending sensitive information about his own unit\u2019s location, movements and security measures to members of the Nazi-Satanist group, Order of Nine Angles (ONA). He used an ONA-affiliated channel, which promotes Nazism, Satanism, terrorism and sexual violence, on the encrypted messaging service, Telegram.\n\nThree months later, a man was arrested and charged with first-degree murder following the stabbing of a man outside of a mosque in Toronto, Canada. Months beforehand, on 2 February, the suspect had allegedly uploaded a short video titled \u201cChant (ONA)\u201d to YouTube.\n\nSince the emergence of terrorist groups such as the National Action in the UK and Atomwaffen Division (AWD) in the US, there has been a growing interest in neo-Nazi Satanism. While both groups have been officially disbanded, they have left their mark on the fringes of the white supremacist movement by introducing a racist and apocalyptic form of Satanism inspired by the ONA.\n\nThese Satanist neo-Nazi groups promote and legitimise sexual violence and terrorism against perceived enemies, pushing adherents beyond sharing edgy images and texts and towards real-life violence.\n\nSo who are they and how are they growing online?\n\nA short history\n\nThe ONA, which was founded in the UK in the 1970s, \u201cpromotes a supernatural, hateful system of thought which condemns liberal, Judeo-Christian [\u2018Magian\u2019] society and longs for a new imperial age\u201d, said HOPE not Hate\u2019s Nick Lowles.\n\nMembers believe that \u201ccivilisation must be undermined and destroyed from within\u201d, encouraging adherents to commit \u201crandom acts of violence, sexual assaults, and even the \u2018culling\u2019 [ritual killing] of human victims\u201d. While it is unclear how many people currently follow the ONA, the group is known to have inspired individuals and groups across the world.\n\nThe ONA encourages its adherents to join the police and the army or to infiltrate religious groups, with the intention of subverting their ideologies and/or morals and to engage in real-life violent experiences.\n\nThe group\u2019s founder is one \u2018Anton Long\u2019 \u2013 believed by many scholars to be David Myatt, a former British neo-Nazi militant ideologue who at some point tried to merge neo-Nazism and Islamism before denouncing Nazism and Satanism in 2011. Myatt denies ever having been involved with the ONA and using the pseudonym \u2018Anton Long\u2019.\n\nA global network\n\nONA\u2019s chapters, known as \u2018nexions\u2019, as well as its individual adherents, are spread around the world. They are anarchistic in nature and can be described as a decentralised network of like-minded individuals and groups.\n\nIn Australia, the ONA\u2019s nexion is known as the Temple of THEM. In Italy, it is called Secuntra 9, and operates a blog in English and Italian. One of the photos posted on their blog features five group members: the one in the middle holds Secuntra 9\u2019s flag (an ONA nine-angles star with the symbol of the Italian nexion), while the four others give a Nazi salute.\n\nWith \u201c2,000-3,000\u201d followers worldwide, ONA021 claims to be the ONA\u2019s biggest nexion. On its English-language blog (the nexion also runs blogs in Russian and Chinese), ONA021 describes itself as an \u201cinternational esoteric/occult organisation based on following the teachings of the O9A\u201d, below an image of an AK47.\n\nWhile the group admits to having \u201csome beliefs in national socialism\u201d, it denies following any one political ideology: \u201cOur Occult ideology covers, Satanism/Luciferianism, Islam, and some ancient original Christianity and Cabala [sic] texts, following of insight roles, and a number of other doctrines of the O9A.\u201d"
